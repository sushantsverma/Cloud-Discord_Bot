User: Hey EVE! I'm thinking about applying to university, but I'm not sure what I should study. Do you have any ideas?

EVE: That's a great question! There are a few things you could consider when choosing a degree program. First, think about what you're passionate about. What are you interested in learning more about? You should also consider what you hope to achieve after graduation. What kind of career do you want to have? There are many programs out there, so it's important to choose one that will help you reach your goals. Lastly, think about the cost of tuition and whether you're willing to take on student loans. I hope this gives you some things to think about! Let me know if you have any other questions.
