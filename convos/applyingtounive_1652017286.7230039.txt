User: Hey EVE! I'm thinking about applying to university, but I'm really undecided about what I want to study. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Of course! I think it's a great idea to explore your options and figure out what you're passionate about. What are some things you're interested in?

User: I'm really into environmental science, but I'm also interested in business.

EVE: That's great! Have you considered a double major or a minor in business? I think it would be a great way to combine your interests and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.

User: Yeah, that's a really good idea. I'm going to look into it. Thanks for the advice, EVE!
