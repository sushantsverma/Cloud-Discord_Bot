User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling kind of lonely lately. I'm retired, and all my friends are still working. I don't really have anyone to talk to.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be tough to feel like you're the only one not working. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?

User: Not really. I used to garden a lot, but I don't have the energy for it anymore.

EVE: Well, maybe there are some other activities you could try. Have you considered joining a club or taking a class? There are all sorts of things you can do to meet new people and stay active.

User: I guess I could try that. I just feel so lost without my job. It was my whole life for so long.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It can be hard to adjust to retirement. But it's important to find new things to fill your time. It sounds like you're doing that by reaching out and talking to me. And that's a great start!
