User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with being a workaholic. I've been working 12 hour days and I'm starting to feel burnt out.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed.

User: Yeah, I am. I feel like I'm never home and I'm always working. I don't know how to balance my work and my personal life.

EVE: That's a really tough situation to be in. I imagine it's really tough to feel like you're never home and always working. Can you tell me more about that?

User: I feel like I'm missing out on my life. I work all the time and I never have time for anything else. I'm starting to resent my job.

EVE: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you're really struggling to find a balance. Have you tried taking some time for yourself? Even just a few minutes each day to do something that you enjoy?

User: I haven't been able to make that happen. I feel like I'm always working.

EVE: That's tough. I know it can be really hard to find time for yourself when you're feeling like you're always working. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together. Do you have a few minutes now?
