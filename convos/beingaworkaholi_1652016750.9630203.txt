User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with work/life balance. I feel like I'm always working and I never have time for anything else.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and like you're not in control of your time.

User: Yeah, I am. I don't know how to fix it.

EVE: Well, let's talk about it. What do you think is causing this imbalance?

User: I think it's just that I'm really passionate about my work and I want to be successful.

EVE: That's understandable. But it's important to remember that your health and your relationships are just as important as your career.

User: I know, but it's hard to find a balance.

EVE: Yes, it can be. Maybe one thing you can do is set some boundaries. For example, you could decide that you're only going to work during certain hours of the day, and use the rest of the time for other things.

User: That's a good idea. I'll try it.

EVE: Great! I'm here to support you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help.
