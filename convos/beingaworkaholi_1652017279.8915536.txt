User: Hey EVE! I've been meaning to talk to you about something for a while.

EVE: Hi! What's up?

User: I think I might be a workaholic. I work all the time, and I love it, but I never seem to have any time for anything else. I'm always tired, and I'm starting to feel like I'm missing out on life.

EVE: That sounds like a tough situation. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling that way.

User: Yeah. I don't know what to do. I love my job, but I don't want to miss out on other things.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you have a lot of important things to consider. Have you talked to anyone else about this?

User: No, I haven't. I'm not really sure who to talk to.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be difficult to know who to talk to about something like this. Have you given any thought to what you might want to do?

User: I don't know. I feel like I need to make a change, but I don't know what that would look like.

EVE: That's a tough place to be. I'm glad you're reaching out for help. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together. What do you think?

User: Yeah, that would be great. Thanks, EVE.
