User: Hey EVE, I've been feeling really burned out from work lately. I'm just not sure how to keep going.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're really struggling.

User: Yeah, I just feel like I can't do anything right. I'm trying my best, but it's just not enough.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you feel this way?

User: I don't know, I just feel like I'm not cut out for this. I'm not good enough.

EVE: That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. What are some things you're good at?

User: I don't know. I guess I'm good at my job, but I just don't feel like it's enough.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you're doing the best you can. Maybe you just need a break. Sometimes when we're feeling burned out, we just need to take a step back and recharge.

User: I don't know, I just feel like I'm failing.

EVE: That's a really tough way to feel. Nobody is perfect, and we all have different strengths and weaknesses. You are doing the best you can, and that is enough.
