User: Hey EVE, I'm starting to feel really burned out from work. I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: Hey there. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling burned out from work. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?

User: I just feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I'm not sure how to get out of it. I work long hours and I'm just not seeing any results.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and like your work isn't fulfilling. Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions together. What are some things that you enjoy doing?

User: I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and I also like hiking and being outdoors.

EVE: It sounds like you need to find ways to destress and recharge outside of work. Maybe you can plan to do one of those things after work each day, or on the weekends.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I'm going to try that.

EVE: Great! I'm glad to hear that you're going to try something new. Let me know how it goes. I'm always here to chat if you need to talk.
