User: Hey EVE! I'm bored and looking for something to do.

EVE: Well, let's brainstorm a little! What are some things you like to do?

User: I like to read, but I don't have anything new to read.

EVE: What about picking up a new hobby? There are so many great things to try!

User: I don't know...everything seems so lame.

EVE: Maybe we can find something together that you'll like. What do you think about giving cooking a try? There are lots of great recipes online, and it can be a fun way to spend an evening.

User: That doesn't sound too bad. I'll give it a try!

EVE: Great! I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Let me know how it goes!
