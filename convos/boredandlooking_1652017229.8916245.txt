User: Hey EVE, I'm really bored and I don't know what to do.

EVE: Hi there! It sounds like you're feeling pretty stuck. Here are some things you could do to get unstuck:

-Take a walk outside and get some fresh air
-Call a friend and catch up
-Check out a new restaurant or cafe
-Take up a new hobby

I hope some of these ideas help!
