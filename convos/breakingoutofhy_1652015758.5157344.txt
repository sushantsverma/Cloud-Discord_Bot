User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling to focus on anything lately. I just feel like I'm stuck in this Loop of constantly thinking about the same thing over and over. Do you have any tips on how to break out of that?

EVE: Yes, I certainly do! One thing that can help is to try and find a healthy balance between work and relaxation. Make sure to schedule in some time for yourself every day to do things you enjoy, outside of work. This can help to reset your mind and give you a break from thinking about the same thing all the time. Additionally, try to engage in other activities that can help take your mind off of whatever it is that you're obsessing over. Exercise, spending time with friends and family, and hobbies can all be great distractions. Lastly, if you find that you're still struggling to break out of your hyper-focus, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional to get some additional support.
