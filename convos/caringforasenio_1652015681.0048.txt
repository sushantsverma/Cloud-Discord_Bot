User: Hey EVE. I need some advice. I'm taking care of my grandma who has dementia. It's really hard. I'm starting to get really frustrated.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been a really tough experience for you. I can imagine how frustrating it must be.

User: Yeah. I just don't know how to deal with it. She gets angry and confused a lot. I try to be patient, but it's hard.

EVE: It sounds like you're doing your best, but it's understandably difficult. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm not doing enough. I'm worried that I'm not being patient enough, or that I'm not being understanding. I don't want her to be angry or confused.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure. You want to do everything you can to help your grandma, but it's tough. I completely understand.

User: Yeah. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's talk about what's been working and what hasn't. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together.
