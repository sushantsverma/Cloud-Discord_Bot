User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to cope with my grandma's dementia. It's really hard seeing her deteriorate like this.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been a really tough few months for you.

User: Yeah. I'm just feeling really helpless right now.

EVE: That makes total sense. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's been going on?

User: It's just been really hard to see her lose her memories and her sense of self. She doesn't even remember who I am half the time.

EVE: That must be really difficult for you. Have you been spending a lot of time with her lately?

User: Yeah, I've been trying to. But it's just really hard.

EVE: It sounds like you're doing your best, and that's really commendable. What kind of support have you been getting from your family and friends?

User: They've been really great. But I guess I just feel like I'm not doing enough.

EVE: I think you're doing more than you realize. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of guilt and responsibility right now.

User: Yeah. I just wish I could do more.

EVE: It sounds like you're already doing a lot. Maybe there's something else you can do to help you cope with this situation. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? They might be able to offer you some additional support.
