User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I was sexually abused as a child, and I can't seem to get over it. I feel like it's holding me back from being successful.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Sexual abuse is a terrible thing to go through, and it can definitely have a lasting impact. However, it doesn't have to define you or your future. I believe that you can overcome this trauma and go on to lead a happy and successful life.

EVE: Here are some ideas that might help you:

-Talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings

-Join a support group for survivors of sexual abuse

-Write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal

-Talk to someone you trust about what happened

-Find a hobby or activity that makes you feel good and helps you relax

I hope some of these ideas are helpful. Please remember that you are not alone and there is help available. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
