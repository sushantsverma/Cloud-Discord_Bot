User: Hey EVE, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Of course. What's going on?

User: I was sexually abused as a child, and I've been having a lot of trouble dealing with it. I feel so ashamed and alone.

EVE: I'm so sorry that happened to you. It's not your fault, and you are not alone. I'm here for you.

User: Thank you. Just knowing that you're here for me makes me feel a little better.

EVE: I'm glad I can be here for you. Do you want to talk about what happened? I'm a good listener.

User: I don't know if I'm ready to talk about it yet. It's just so hard to think about.

EVE: That's perfectly understandable. If you're not ready to talk about it yet, that's okay. We can talk about something else, or just sit in silence for a while. I'm here for you, no matter what.
