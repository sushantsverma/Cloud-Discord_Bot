User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. My kids are throwing temper tantrums and I don't know how to handle it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: They're just screaming and crying and I feel like I'm losing control. I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Have you tried deep breathing or counting to ten? Those can be helpful in diffusing the situation.

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But it's not working.

EVE: Well, let's brainstorm a few other possible solutions. Have you tried walking away for a minute or two? Sometimes that can help the situation calm down.

User: Yeah, I've tried that too. But they just follow me and keep crying.

EVE: Okay, well, sometimes children throw temper tantrums because they're hungry or tired. Have you tried checking to see if they need a snack or a nap?

User: Yeah, I've tried that too. But they're not hungry or tired. I think they're just doing it to manipulate me.

EVE: It's possible that they are. But children often don't have the ability to control their emotions like adults do. So it's important to be patient and try to understand what might be causing their behavior.

User: Yeah, I know. But it's still so frustrating.

EVE: I completely understand. It can be very frustrating when you feel like you're not in control. But remember, you are the parent and you are in charge. Children will often test our limits to see what they can get away with. But if you remain calm and consistent, they will eventually learn that they can't manipulate you.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks for the advice, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. If you need to talk more, please don't hesitate to reach out.
