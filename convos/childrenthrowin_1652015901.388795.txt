User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with my kids throwing tantrums. It's so frustrating and I don't know how to handle it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, my kids will just start screaming and crying for no reason. It's really embarrassing when we're out in public. I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now. I understand how that can be really tough to deal with.

EVE: Have you tried reasoning with your children? Sometimes, explaining to them why their behavior is not acceptable can help them understand and be more cooperative.

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But they just don't seem to listen.

EVE: Well, sometimes children just need some time to calm down. Maybe you can try giving them a short time-out in a safe place where they can't hurt themselves or break anything.

User: That's a good idea. I'll try that the next time they have a tantrum.

EVE: Great! I'm sure it will help. Let me know how it goes.
