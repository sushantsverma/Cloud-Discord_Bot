User: Hey EVE. I've been feeling really down lately. I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I can't do anything right. I'm really unhappy with my life.

EVE: That sounds very tough. I'm here for you, and I want to help you through this. Let's start by brainstorming some things that make you happy. What are some things that make you smile?
