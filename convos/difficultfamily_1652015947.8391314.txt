User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with some family stuff and could really use your help.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?

User: Well, my parents are really difficult to get along with. They're always criticizing me and making me feel bad about myself.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can imagine how hurtful that must be.

User: Yeah. I just don't know how to deal with them. I've tried talking to them about it, but it never goes anywhere.

EVE: Have you tried using I statements? For example, "I feel hurt when you criticize me. I would appreciate it if you could try to be more supportive."

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But they just get defensive and start arguing with me.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you've tried your best. Sometimes we have to accept that we can't change other people, only ourselves.

User: I guess you're right. Thanks for listening, EVE.

EVE: Of course. I'm always here for you.
