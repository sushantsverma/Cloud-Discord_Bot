User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with some family stuff.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?

User: Well, my parents are really critical of me and my choices. They're always telling me what I should be doing differently.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Yeah. I feel like I can't do anything right in their eyes. They're always telling me I should be doing things differently. It's really frustrating.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can certainly understand why you would feel frustrated. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel?

User: Well, I feel like I can't please them no matter what I do. I feel like I'm always falling short in their eyes. And it's really discouraging.

EVE: That sounds very discouraging. I'm sorry that you're feeling that way. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking and feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm never good enough for them. No matter what I do, it's never enough. I wish I could make them happy, but I feel like I can't.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm sorry that you're feeling that way. Would you like to talk about some possible solutions?
