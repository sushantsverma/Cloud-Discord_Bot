User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with some people at work. I feel like they're always out to get me, and I can't seem to make them like me.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated.

User: Yeah. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's brainstorm a few possible solutions. First, have you tried being extra nice to them?

User: I've tried that, but it doesn't seem to work.

EVE: Okay. What about ignoring them?

User: That doesn't work either. They just keep bugging me.

EVE: Hmm. Well, sometimes people act difficult because they're insecure. Maybe you could try complimenting them or being extra friendly.

User: I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.
