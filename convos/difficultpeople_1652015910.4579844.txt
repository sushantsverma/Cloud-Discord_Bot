User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling with some people at work. I'm not sure how to deal with them.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the situation?

User: Well, there are a few people who are just really difficult to work with. They're always complaining and causing problems.

EVE: I see. That sounds like it could be tough to deal with.

User: Yeah, it is. I've tried talking to them and being nice, but it doesn't seem to help.

EVE: Well, sometimes people can be difficult to get along with, no matter what you do. But there might be some things you can do to make the situation better.

User: Like what?

EVE: Well, one thing you could try is to really listen to them when they're talking, and try to understand where they're coming from. Sometimes people just need to be heard.

User: That makes sense. I'll try that.

EVE: Great! I'm sure it will help. Let me know how it goes.
