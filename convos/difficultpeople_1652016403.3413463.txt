User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling at work. I have a lot of difficult people around me, and it's really tough to get through the day.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been a tough few weeks. Can you tell me more about the people who are causing you difficulties?

User: Well, there's my boss. She's always putting me down and making me feel like I'm not good enough. And then there's my co-worker. He's always trying to one-up me and make me look bad.

EVE: That sounds like a tough situation. I can understand why you're struggling. Have you tried talking to them about how you're feeling?

User: I've tried, but it never goes well. My boss always shuts me down, and my co-worker just laughs at me.

EVE: Maybe there's another way to approach the situation. Have you considered talking to HR? Or maybe there's someone else at work who you can confide in?

User: I don't know. I don't want to make things worse.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling. I want to help you find a solution that will work for you. Let's brainstorm a few ideas and see if we can come up with something that will help you feel better about the situation.
