User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with a few people at work. I don't know how to deal with them.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the situation?

User: Well, there are a few people who are just really difficult to work with. They're always pushing my buttons and trying to get under my skin. I don't know how to deal with them without losing my cool.

EVE: That sounds like a tough situation. I can understand why you're struggling. Here are a few things that might help you deal with difficult people at work:

1. Try to understand where they're coming from. It's possible that they're difficult because they're going through a tough time themselves.

2. Don't take everything they say or do personally. They might not be deliberately trying to upset you, they might just be having a bad day.

3. Try to stay calm and constructive when you're talking to them. Getting angry or defensive will only make the situation worse.

I hope these tips help you. Please let me know if you need any more support.
