User: Hey EVE! I'm really interested in dinosaurs. Do you know anything about them?

EVE: Yes, I certainly do! Dinosaurs are fascinating creatures that have captured the imaginations of people for centuries. There are many different types of dinosaurs, and scientists are still learning new things about them all the time. I'm happy to share what I know about dinosaurs with you, and I'm sure you'll find them just as interesting as I do!
