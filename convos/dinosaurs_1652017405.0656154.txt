User: Hey EVE! I've been feeling really down lately. I think I need some help.

EVE: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling down. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm not doing anything with my life. I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any goals. I just feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you might benefit from some goal-setting and thinking about what you're passionate about.

User: Yeah, I think you're right. I just don't know where to start.

EVE: That's okay! We can take it one step at a time. Let's start with brainstorming some potential hobbies or interests that you might want to pursue.

User: Okay.

EVE: Do you like animals?

User: Yeah, I love animals.

EVE: Okay, there are lots of potential hobbies or activities that revolve around animals. For example, you could volunteer at a local animal shelter, or start taking care of pets for other people in your neighborhood.

User: That's a great idea! I'm definitely going to look into that.

EVE: Great! I'm glad I could help. If you need any more ideas or suggestions, don't hesitate to let me know.
