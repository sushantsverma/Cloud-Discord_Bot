User: Hey EVE. I feel like I'm just drifting through life without a purpose.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling lost.

User: Yeah. I don't know what I want to do with my life.

EVE: That's a common feeling. A lot of people feel like they don't have a purpose in life.

User: What should I do?

EVE: There are a few things you can do. First, you can try to figure out what you're passionate about. What are the things you love to do? What makes you feel alive? Once you figure out what you're passionate about, you can start pursuing that.

Another thing you can do is to set some goals for yourself. What do you want to accomplish in life? What kind of person do you want to be? Once you have some goals, you can start working towards them.

Finally, you can try to find meaning in the things you're already doing. Even if you don't have a specific goal or passion, you can still find ways to make your life meaningful. For example, you can be a good friend, a good neighbor, or a good citizen. You can make a difference in the world in your own small way.

I hope this helps. If you need to talk more, please don't hesitate to message me.
