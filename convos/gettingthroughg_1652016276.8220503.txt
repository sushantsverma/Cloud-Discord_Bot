User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling to get through grad school. I'm finding it hard to keep up with the workload, and I'm feeling really stressed out all the time.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just really hard. I feel like I'm never going to be able to finish.

EVE: That doesn't sound like a very positive attitude. What can you do to turn that around?

User: I don't know. It's just hard to stay motivated when I feel like I'm never going to make it through.

EVE: Well, one thing you can do is to take it one day at a time. Don't try to think about the entire process, just focus on today. And remind yourself that you're capable of doing this.

User: Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

EVE: Of course it does. You're a smart, capable person, and you can do this. Just stay focused and don't get too discouraged.
