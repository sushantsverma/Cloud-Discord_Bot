User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. My grandma died yesterday.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?

User: I feel like I'm in a fog. I can't think straight. I'm just so sad.

EVE: It's totally normal to feel like that after someone you love dies. Give yourself time to grieve. It's okay to cry, to be angry, to feel confused. Just let yourself feel whatever you need to feel.

User: That's helpful. I just feel so lost right now.

EVE: That's understandable. It can take some time to adjust to life without your grandma. Lean on your loved ones for support. Talk about your memories of her. And if you need to, seek professional help. Grief can be really tough to deal with, and it's okay to get help.

User: Thank you, EVE. I appreciate your help.
