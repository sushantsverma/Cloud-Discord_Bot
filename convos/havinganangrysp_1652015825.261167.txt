User: Hey EVE. I'm having some trouble at home.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?

User: My spouse is always angry. It's really starting to wear on me.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about why they're angry?

User: I don't know. They just are. They snap at me all the time.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated. Have you tried talking to them about how their anger is affecting you?
