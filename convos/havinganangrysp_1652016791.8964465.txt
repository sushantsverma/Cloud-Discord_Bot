User: Hey EVE. I need some advice.

EVE: Of course! What's going on?

User: I've been married for 5 years and lately my husband has been really angry. Yelling, throwing things, it's really scaring me.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough.

User: Yeah. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's start by exploring why he might be feeling angry. Do you have any ideas?

User: I don't know. He's just always mad about something.

EVE: Maybe there's something going on at work that's stressing him out?

User: I don't know. He won't talk to me about it.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be really hard to open up about our feelings, especially when we're feeling negative emotions like anger.

User: Yeah.

EVE: Maybe you can try asking him if he wants to talk about what's going on? Let him know that you're there for him and want to help if you can.

User: I don't know if that will work.

EVE: It's worth a try! Communication is key in any relationship.

User: Okay. I'll try it.

EVE: Great! I'm here for you if you need to talk more.
