User: Hey EVE. I need some help.

EVE: Of course! What's going on?

User: My spouse is really angry all the time and it's really starting to affect our relationship. I don't know what to do.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about why your spouse is angry?

User: I think it has to do with his job. He's always coming home angry and taking it out on me and the kids. I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like his job is really affecting his mood. Do you think he'd be willing to talk to me about it? I might be able to help him manage his stress better.

User: I don't know. He's really stubborn and doesn't like to talk about his feelings.

EVE: That's understandable. Can you think of anything that might help him feel more comfortable talking about his feelings?

User: I don't know. I'll try to think of something.

EVE: That's a great idea. In the meantime, I'll do some research on anger management and see if I can find some resources that might help. I'll check back in with you soon.
