User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with maintaining boundaries in my relationships. I always end up getting taken advantage of and feeling used.

EVE: Hi there! That sounds like a really tough situation to be in. Have you tried setting boundaries in your relationships before?

User: Yeah, I've tried. But I always end up feeling bad about it because I don't want to hurt the other person's feelings.

EVE: That's a really common struggle! A lot of people have a hard time setting boundaries because they don't want to hurt the other person. But it's important to remember that boundaries are for your benefit too, not just the other person's. They help you protect your time, energy, and resources.

User: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. But it's still really hard for me to do.

EVE: That's totally understandable. It can be really hard to change the way you've been doing things for a long time. But I believe in you, and I know you can do it! Here are some tips that might help:

-Start small. Don't try to set a bunch of boundaries all at once. Just pick one or two to start with.

-Be assertive. When you're setting a boundary, be firm and confident. Don't let the other person talk you out of it.

-Give yourself grace. Don't beat yourself up if you mess up or if the other person doesn't respond well. Just keep trying, and you'll eventually get the hang of it!
