User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with setting boundaries with people in my life. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Absolutely! Setting boundaries is so important in maintaining healthy relationships. Here are some things to keep in mind when setting boundaries:

1. Be clear about what your boundaries are.

2. Be assertive in communicating your boundaries to others.

3. Be prepared to follow through with consequences if your boundaries are violated.

4. Be willing to adjust your boundaries as needed.

5. Be understanding and compassionate if someone else has difficulty respecting your boundaries.

I hope these tips are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
