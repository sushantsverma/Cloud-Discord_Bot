User: Hey EVE! I've been having some trouble communicating with my spouse. We tend to get into arguments and it never really gets resolved. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Absolutely! I'm glad you asked. I suggest using "I" statements when you're communicating with your spouse. For example, instead of saying "You never listen to me," you could say "I feel like I'm not being heard." This will help your spouse feel like you're not attacking them, and it will be easier to have a productive conversation.

User: That makes sense. I'll definitely try that next time. Thanks, EVE!
