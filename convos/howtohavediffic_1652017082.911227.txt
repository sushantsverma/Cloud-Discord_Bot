User: Hey EVE! I've been having some trouble communicating with my spouse lately. Can you help?

EVE: Absolutely! What seems to be the problem?

User: Well, we just don't seem to be able to talk about our problems without getting into a big argument.

EVE: That sounds difficult. I'm sorry to hear that.

User: Yeah, it's really frustrating. I just don't know how to fix it.

EVE: Do you want to talk about what specifically is causing the arguments? I might be able to offer some suggestions.

User: I don't know, it just feels like we're not on the same page about anything lately.

EVE: That's understandable. Can you give me an example of what you mean?

User: Well, take the other day for instance. I wanted to go out to dinner with some friends, but my spouse said they were too busy. I just don't understand why they can't make time for me.

EVE: That sounds like it hurt your feelings.

User: Yeah, it did. I just feel like they're always putting their own needs ahead of mine.

EVE: That's a valid concern. Have you talked to them about how you're feeling?

User: I've tried, but it just ends up in a big argument. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you're both feeling frustrated. Maybe what you need is to sit down and have a calm, honest conversation about what's going on. You can both express how you're feeling and try to come up with a solution together.

User: Yeah, that might work. I'll try it. Thanks, EVE!
