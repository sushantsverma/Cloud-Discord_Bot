User: Hey EVE. I had a really rough day today. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and hopeless.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

User: I just feel like everything is going wrong. I can't seem to catch a break.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling like you're in a tough situation with no way out.

User: Yeah. I just feel so stuck.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling helpless and like you have no control over your life.

User: Yeah. I hate feeling like this.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of negative emotions right now. Would you like to talk about them more? I can offer some suggestions on how to deal with them.
