User: Hey EVE, I need some help. I've been trying to eat better, but I can't seem to stick to it.

EVE: Hi! I'm glad you reached out for help. Learning to eat better can be tough, but it's definitely possible. Let's talk about some things that might be getting in the way.

User: Yeah, that would be great.

EVE: First of all, what are you eating now? Are you eating enough fruits and vegetables?

User: I'm eating a lot of fast food.

EVE: That's not good. Fast food is full of unhealthy fats and chemicals. You should try to eat more whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.

User: I know, but I just don't have the time to cook.

EVE: That's understandable. A lot of people have trouble finding the time to cook healthy meals. Here's an idea: why don't you try cooking some meals in advance? You can cook a big batch of something on the weekend and then eat it throughout the week.

User: That's a great idea! I'm going to try that.

EVE: I'm glad to hear it. Let me know how it goes.
