User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling a lot lately with taking care of myself. I never make time for myself and I'm always putting other people first.

EVE: That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about why you think you don't deserve to take care of yourself?

User: I don't know. I guess I just feel like there's always someone who needs me more than I need me.

EVE: That's a really common feeling, but it's not true! You deserve to take care of yourself just as much as anyone else.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. I just don't know how to start making time for myself.

EVE: Well, let's start with something small. Can you commit to taking 10 minutes for yourself every day? Just to do something that you enjoy, without feeling guilty about it.

User: Yeah, I can do that.

EVE: Great! I'm proud of you for making this commitment. I know you can do it!
