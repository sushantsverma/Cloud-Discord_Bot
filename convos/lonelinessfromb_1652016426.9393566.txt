User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. I've been single for a long time and I'm feeling really lonely.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Loneliness is a tough feeling to deal with. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling lonely?

User: I guess I just don't have anyone to share my life with. I see all my friends in relationships and I feel like I'm missing out.

EVE: It's totally normal to feel that way. A lot of people feel lonely when they're single. But it's important to remember that being in a relationship isn't the only source of happiness. There are lots of things you can do to combat loneliness.

User: Like what?

EVE: Well, you can focus on building strong relationships with your friends and family. You can also get involved in activities and hobbies that make you happy. And there's nothing wrong with spending some time alone. A lot of people actually find that they enjoy their own company.

User: I guess you're right. I just need to find things that make me happy.

EVE: Absolutely. And if you ever need to talk, I'm here for you.
