User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with some office politics stuff. My boss is constantly putting me down in front of other people, and I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: It's just that she always has some snarky comment to make about my work, and it's really getting to me. I don't know how to make her stop.

EVE: Well, first of all, it's important to remember that you can't control other people's behavior. But you can control how you react to it.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right.

EVE: One thing you might try is to reframe the situation in your own mind. Instead of getting upset, try to see it as a challenge. Can you use this as an opportunity to learn and grow?

User: Hmm, that's a good perspective. I'll try to remember that next time she says something.

EVE: Great! I'm confident you'll be able to handle this. Let me know how it goes.
