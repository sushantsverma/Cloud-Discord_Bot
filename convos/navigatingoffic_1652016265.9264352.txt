User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with office politics. It seems like every day, there's some new drama. I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: Hi there! Office politics can be tough to navigate. Let's see if we can figure out a plan together.

User: Yeah, that would be great. I just feel so stressed all the time.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm here to help you, so please don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything.

User: Thank you, EVE. Just knowing you're here for me is already helping.

EVE: You're very welcome. So, have you given any thought to how you'd like to approach this situation?

User: I'm not really sure. I've tried to ignore it, but that doesn't seem to be working.

EVE: Yes, it can be hard to ignore office drama. But sometimes, that's the best approach. If you don't engage, it might die down on its own.

User: I don't know if that will work, but I'm willing to try it.

EVE: Great! I think it's definitely worth a shot. And if it doesn't work, we can brainstorm some other ideas.

User: OK, thanks EVE. I feel better already.
