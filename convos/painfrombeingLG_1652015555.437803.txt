User: Hey EVE, I hope you're doing well. I've been struggling lately.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: I'm LGBT and I have to keep it hidden from everyone. It's so hard living a lie.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can imagine how much pain that must cause you.

User: It does. I feel like I can't be myself around anyone.

EVE: That must be really tough. Have you talked to anyone about this?

User: No, I can't. If anyone found out, they would reject me.

EVE: That's understandable. It's hard to open up about something like this when you're not sure how others will react.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you're doing a lot of internal processing right now. That's understandable. Maybe you can try journaling about your thoughts and feelings on this? It might help you to get them out and to start exploring what you want to do next.

User: That's a good idea. Thank you, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. If you ever want to talk more about this, I'm here for you.
