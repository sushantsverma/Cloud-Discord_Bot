User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm a new mom and I think I might have postpartum depression.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?

User: I just feel really down all the time. I'm exhausted and I can't seem to enjoy anything.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I'm glad you're reaching out for help.

User: I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm failing as a mom.

EVE: You're not failing. This is a difficult time for you, but you're doing the best you can.

User: Thank you. Just talking to you is helping.

EVE: I'm glad I could be here for you. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
