User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with postpartum depression and I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I'm feeling really down and helpless. I'm not enjoying anything anymore and I'm having a hard time taking care of my baby.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I'm so sorry that you're going through this.

User: I don't know what to do. I've been trying to talk to my husband about it but he doesn't really understand.

EVE: That must be really difficult for you. It sounds like you feel like you're not being heard or understood.

EVE: Have you considered seeking professional help? Sometimes it can be really helpful to talk to someone who understands what you're going through.

User: I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk to a stranger about this.

EVE: That's understandable. If you're not ready to seek professional help, are there any other supports that you can lean on? Friends, family, online support groups?

User: I guess I could try talking to my mom. I'm not sure if she'll really understand but it's worth a shot.

EVE: That's a great idea. Sometimes it can be helpful to talk to someone who's been through something similar.

EVE: I'm here for you too, if you ever need to talk. I'm always happy to listen.
