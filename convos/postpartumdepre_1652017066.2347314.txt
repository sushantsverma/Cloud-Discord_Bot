User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I had a baby 6 months ago and I can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and emptiness.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time.

User: Yeah. I just feel so alone and like I'm not doing anything right.

EVE: It's common to feel like that after having a baby. Your life has changed a lot and it can be hard to adjust.

User: I just feel like I'm failing as a mother.

EVE: That's a normal feeling, too. A lot of mothers feel that way. It doesn't mean that you are failing, though. You're doing the best you can.

User: I guess you're right. I just need some help. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's start by talking about what's going on. What are your biggest concerns?
