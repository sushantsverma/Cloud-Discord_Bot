User: Hey EVE. I've been thinking a lot lately about my gender and sexuality. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the labels I've been using to identify myself.

EVE: That sounds like a really tough thing to deal with. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?

User: I guess I just don't feel like I fit into any one category. I like some things that are typically associated with one gender, and other things that are typically associated with another gender. And I'm not sure if I'm attracted to people of any gender.

EVE: That sounds confusing and complicated. There's no right or wrong answer here, so you should do whatever feels right for you. Have you talked to anyone else about this?

User: No, I haven't. I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk to anyone else about it yet.

EVE: That's okay. You can take your time. If and when you're ready to talk to someone else about it, I'm sure they'll be supportive. In the meantime, if you ever want to talk about it with me, I'm here for you.
