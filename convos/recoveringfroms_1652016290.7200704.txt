User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I was in a car accident a few months ago and I'm still recovering. I'm in a lot of pain and I don't know how to get through it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. How are you doing emotionally?

User: I'm really frustrated. I can't do anything that I used to do. I'm stuck at home all the time and I'm just really bored.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling lonely and helpless. Those are totally normal feelings to have after an accident. Have you talked to your doctor about your pain?

User: Yeah, I'm on some medication but it's not really helping. I'm just really frustrated.

EVE: I completely understand. It sounds like you're doing everything you can to recover, but it's just taking some time. Be patient with yourself and don't be too hard on yourself. You'll get there.
