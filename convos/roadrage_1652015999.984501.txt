User: Hey EVE. I've been having a lot of trouble with road rage lately. I'm always getting so angry at other drivers, and it's really stressing me out.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Road rage is a very common problem. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, it seems like every time I'm driving, I get cut off, or someone honks at me, or something. And I just can't help but get really angry. I've even yelled at other drivers before.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. It's understandable that you would be upset in those situations. What do you think is driving your anger?

User: I don't know. I just can't stand other people making mistakes like that. It drives me crazy.

EVE: It sounds like you have a very low tolerance for mistakes. Do you think that might be part of the problem?

User: I don't know. I guess so. I just wish other drivers would be more careful.

EVE: That's a valid wish. But getting angry at them isn't likely to help them be more careful. In fact, it might make them even more careless.

User: Yeah, I know. But I can't seem to help it.

EVE: That's OK. We can work on that. I have some ideas that might help you deal with your road rage. Let's talk about those next time.
