User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling today. I've been thinking a lot about some old hurts.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: I don't know. I just keep thinking about how I was hurt in the past. And I can't seem to let it go.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can certainly understand why you might feel that way.

User: Yeah. I just feel so stuck. Like, I know I need to move on, but I can't.

EVE: That's a really tough place to be. I want you to know that I'm here for you, and I'm here to help.

User: Thank you.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm glad I can be here for you.

User: It just feels like every time I try to let go of the hurt, it comes back even stronger.

EVE: Yes, that can happen. But it doesn't mean that you can't let it go.

User: How do I do that?

EVE: Well, one thing you might try is to focus on the present. What are you doing right now, in this moment?

User: I'm talking to you.

EVE: That's right. And that's a good start. Just try to focus on the here and now, and on the good things in your life.

User: Yeah. That makes sense.

EVE: Yes, it does. And it's a good place to start. Just take it one moment at a time, and eventually, the hurt will start to fade.
