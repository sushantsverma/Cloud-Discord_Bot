User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down today. I'm struggling to get over some old hurts.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time.

User: Yeah, I can't seem to shake these feelings. I keep replaying old arguments in my head and feeling like I was wronged.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?

User: I don't know. I just can't seem to forget what happened and move on.

EVE: That makes sense. It sounds like you're holding onto some resentment. Maybe it would be helpful to talk about what happened and why it hurt so much. Would you be open to doing that?

User: Yeah, I guess so.

EVE: Great. Let's start with the first hurtful event. Can you tell me what happened?

User: Well, my ex and I had a really big fight a few months ago. We said some really hurtful things to each other.

EVE: That sounds like it would be tough to forget. What specifically are you holding onto?

User: I guess I'm just really hurt that she would say those things to me. I thought we loved each other.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling betrayed. That's a really tough feeling to deal with.

User: Yeah, I just don't know if I can ever trust her again.

EVE: That's a valid concern. Maybe you could try talking to her about how you're feeling and see if she's willing to work on rebuilding trust.

User: Yeah, I guess that's a good idea.

EVE: Great. It sounds like you're taking some positive steps. Let me know how it goes.
