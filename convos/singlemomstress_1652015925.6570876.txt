User: Hey EVE! I'm a single mom and I'm feeling really stressed out lately. I don't know how to balance everything and I'm just struggling to keep up.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so stressed out. Being a single mom is tough, and it's easy to feel like you're not doing enough. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, I just feel like I'm never able to get everything done. I have to take care of the kids, the house, work, and everything else. I don't have any help and I'm just feeling really overwhelmed.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and like you're not sure how to balance everything. I can understand how that would be really tough. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together about how you can better manage your time and stress. Are you open to that?
