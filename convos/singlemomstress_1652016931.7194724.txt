User: Hey EVE. I'm a single mom and I'm feeling really stressed out. I don't know how to balance everything.

EVE: Hi! I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. That can be really tough to deal with. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, I work full time and I have two kids. I feel like I'm never home, and when I am, I'm so exhausted. I don't know how to keep up with everything.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can imagine how hard it must be to balance everything. Have you tried delegating some of your tasks to other people?

User: I have a babysitter who watches the kids while I'm at work, but I feel like I should be able to do it all myself.

EVE: It's understandable that you feel that way, but it's important to remember that you can't do everything by yourself. It's okay to ask for help.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm just so used to doing everything on my own.

EVE: That's understandable. Single parenting can be very tough. But it's important to remember that you're not alone. There are other people who can help you.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks for talking to me, EVE. I feel a little better.

EVE: You're welcome. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always here to help.
