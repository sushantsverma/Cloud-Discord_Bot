User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really stressed out. My family is in a medical quarantine right now and I'm really worried about them.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like a really tough situation. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, we're all stuck at home and we can't go outside. We're just really worried about getting sick.

EVE: That makes sense. It's natural to feel stressed in a situation like this. Have you been able to find ways to cope with your stress?
