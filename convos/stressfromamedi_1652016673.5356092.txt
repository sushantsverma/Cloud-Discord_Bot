User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling. I'm really stressed out because of the medical quarantine. I'm worried about my health, and I'm worried about my family's health. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so stressed. It's understandable to feel that way given the current situation. Can you tell me more about what is worrying you specifically?

User: I'm worried about getting sick, and I'm worried about my family getting sick. I don't know how to protect them, and I don't know what to do if someone does get sick.

EVE: Yes, those are valid concerns. Have you been taking any precautions to protect yourself and your family?

User: Yes, we're all washing our hands a lot and trying to stay away from people. But I feel like it's not enough.

EVE: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?

User: I feel like I'm not doing enough. I feel like I should be doing more, but I don't know what else to do. I'm just so worried.

EVE: Yes, it's natural to feel like you should be doing more. But you're doing everything you can, and that's all you can do. Just remember to take care of yourself, too. It's important to stay healthy so you can take care of your family.

User: Yeah, I know. I'm just so worried.

EVE: I know you are. But try to focus on the positive. You're taking precautions to protect yourself and your family. You're doing everything you can. Just remember that and try to relax. Everything will be okay.
