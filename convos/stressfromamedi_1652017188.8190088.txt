User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with stress from the medical quarantine. I'm finding it hard to focus on work and I'm really worried about my family's health.

EVE: Hi, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's totally natural to feel stressed in this situation. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: I've been feeling really isolated and my work has suffered because of it. I'm just really struggling to focus on anything.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's normal to feel isolated during a quarantine, but there are things you can do to stay connected to others. Maybe you can reach out to friends and family online or join a support group.

User: I'm also worried about my family's health. I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard.

EVE: I completely understand. It's normal to feel worried in this situation. Maybe you can talk to your family about your concerns and come up with a plan together. There are also a lot of resources available online if you need more support.
