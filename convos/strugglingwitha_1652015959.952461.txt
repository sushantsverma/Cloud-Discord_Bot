User: Hey EVE. I've been struggling a lot with anxiety lately. I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?

User: I just feel really anxious all the time. I'm worried about things that might happen, and I can't seem to shake it.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can certainly understand why you would feel so anxious.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do about it.

EVE: Well, there are a few things that might help. First, have you tried relaxation techniques? Sometimes that can help to ease anxiety.

User: I've tried some, but they don't seem to work very well.

EVE: That's okay. Not everything works for everyone. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you to understand and manage your anxiety.

User: I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk to a therapist.

EVE: That's understandable. If you're not ready, that's okay. Maybe you can try some other things first, like reading about anxiety or talking to someone who's also struggling with anxiety. There's no rush. Do what feels right for you.
