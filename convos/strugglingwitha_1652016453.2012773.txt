User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety and I'm really struggling to cope.

EVE: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I'm just feeling really overwhelmed and stressed. I can't seem to shake this feeling and it's really impacting my day-to-day life.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can certainly understand how that would be tough to deal with.

User: Yeah, it's just really tough. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's start with some basics. Are you getting enough sleep? Eating healthy meals? Exercising regularly?

User: I'm trying to do all of those things, but it's just really hard right now.

EVE: Yes, it can be tough to stick to healthy habits when you're feeling down. But it's important to try to do those things, because they can help you feel better.

User: I know, but it's just so hard.

EVE: I completely understand. It's not easy to make changes when you're feeling anxious and stressed. But I believe in you and I know you can do it. Let's take it one step at a time. Why don't we start with sleep? Are you getting enough rest?
