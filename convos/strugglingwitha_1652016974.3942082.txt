User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety. I'm finding it hard to focus on anything.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with anxiety. That can be really tough to deal with.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I can't get a handle on it.

EVE: Do you want to talk about what's going on? I'm here to listen.

User: I don't know. It just feels like everything is spinning out of control. I'm worried about work, my relationship, my family. I just feel like I can't catch a break.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. It sounds like you're feeling like you're in a really tough spot right now.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's talk about what you're doing now to manage your anxiety. What have you found helpful in the past?
