User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with calculus. It's just so hard and I don't understand any of it.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about why it's so difficult for you?

User: I don't know. It just is. The concepts are just really confusing and I can't seem to wrap my head around them no matter how many times I try.

EVE: Yes, I can see how that would be very frustrating. Have you tried talking to your teacher or a tutor? Sometimes it helps to get a different perspective from someone who can explain the concepts in a different way.

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But it's just so hard. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you're doing everything you can. Sometimes it just takes a little more time and effort to understand certain concepts. But I believe in you and I know you can do it!
