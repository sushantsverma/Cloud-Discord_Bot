User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling to take care of my special needs child. I feel like I'm failing them.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm not doing enough. I'm always worried that I'm not doing enough for them.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure. Can you tell me more about that?

User: I guess I just feel like I'm not good enough. I see other parents with their kids and they seem to have it all together. But I feel like I'm just flailing.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really insecure right now. That's totally normal. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?
