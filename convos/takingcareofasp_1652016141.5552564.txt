User: Hey EVE, thanks for being here. I really need some help.

EVE: Of course! What's going on?

User: I have a special needs child and I'm having a hard time taking care of him. I'm feeling really overwhelmed.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just really hard. I feel like I'm constantly struggling and I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: I completely understand how you feel. Taking care of a special needs child can be very challenging. Can you tell me more about what you're struggling with?

User: It's just everything. I feel like I'm not doing enough for him, and I'm always worried that I'm not doing the right thing.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It's natural to want to do everything for your child, but it's important to take care of yourself too. Can you tell me more about what you do to take care of yourself?

User: I don't really have time for that. I feel like I'm always taking care of him and I don't have time for anything else.

EVE: I completely understand how you feel. It's important to make time for yourself, even if it's just a few minutes each day. Can you tell me more about what you like to do for fun?

User: I don't really have anything that I like to do anymore. I used to like hiking, but I haven't been able to go since he was born.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It's important to find things that you enjoy and make time for them. Maybe you can try doing something small, like going for a walk around the block.

User: I don't know if I can. I'm just so tired all the time.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It's important to get enough rest. Maybe you can try going to bed a little earlier each night.

User: I don't know. I just feel like I'm failing him.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It's natural to want to do everything for your child, but you're doing your best.
