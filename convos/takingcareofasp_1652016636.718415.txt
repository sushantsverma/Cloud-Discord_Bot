User: Hey EVE. I need some advice. I have a special needs child, and I'm struggling to take care of him. I'm feeling really overwhelmed.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your situation?

User: Well, my son has a lot of medical needs, and I'm just finding it really hard to keep up. I'm afraid I'm not doing a good job.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and like you're not sure if you're doing a good job. That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself. I'm wondering if there's anything we can do to help you feel more supported.

User: I don't know. I guess I just need some help figuring out how to take care of my son. I feel like I'm failing him.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and helpless right now. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to help you feel more empowered.

User: I don't know. I guess I just need some help.

EVE: That's okay. I'm here to help. Let me see if I can find some resources that might be helpful for you.
