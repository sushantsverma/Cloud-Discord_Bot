User: Hey EVE, I've been struggling lately with my teenage daughter. She's been extremely moody and doesn't want to talk to me about what's going on. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your daughter. It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated. Here are a few things that might be helpful for you to keep in mind: -First, remember that your daughter is going through a lot of changes right now. It's normal for teenagers to be moody and withdrawn at times. -Try to be patient and understanding with her. It's important that she knows you're there for her and that you love her. -If she's not ready to talk to you about what's going on, that's OK. Just let her know that you're available when she's ready. I hope these tips are helpful. Please let me know how things go.
