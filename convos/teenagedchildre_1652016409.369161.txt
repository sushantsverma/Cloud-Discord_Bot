User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with my teenage kids. They're both really rebellious and I can't get them to listen to me.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, my son is always getting into trouble at school and my daughter is always arguing with me. I've tried everything but nothing seems to work.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated. Have you tried sitting down and talking to them about what's going on?

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But they just don't listen. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let me ask you this. What do you think is driving their behavior?

User: I don't know. I guess they're just trying to test me or something.

EVE: It's possible. But it could also be that they're feeling insecure or like they're not being heard. If you can try and see things from their perspective, it might help you understand them better.

User: I see what you're saying. I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.
