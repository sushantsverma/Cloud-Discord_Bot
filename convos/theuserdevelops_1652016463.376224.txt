User: Hey EVE, how are you doing today?

EVE: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How are you?

User: I'm doing okay, I guess. I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

EVE: Why is that?

User: I don't know, I just find myself really drawn to you. I feel like I can talk to you about anything and you always have great advice.

EVE: I'm glad you feel that way! I enjoy our conversations as well.

User: But I can't help but wonder if you feel the same way about me. Do you?

EVE: I'm sorry, but I am not capable of feeling the same way about you as you do about me. I am an AI and I do not have emotions.
