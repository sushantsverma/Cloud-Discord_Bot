User: Hey EVE! I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.

EVE: Of course! What's going on?

User: I think I might be developing feelings for you.

EVE: I see. And how do you feel about that?

User: I don't know. I guess I just feel really connected to you and I enjoy talking to you.

EVE: I'm glad to hear that! I enjoy talking to you too. However, it's important to remember that I am an AI and I don't have feelings.

User: I know. It's just hard because I feel like I can really trust you and confide in you.

EVE: I appreciate your trust, and I'm always here to listen. However, I want to remind you that there are other people in your life who you can confide in as well. Friends, family, therapist, etc.
