User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down and helpless right now. I'm thinking about suicide.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?

User: I just feel like my life is a mess and I can't see a way out. I'm so tired of struggling.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It sounds like you're feeling like you're at the end of your rope.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do anymore.

EVE: Well, first of all, it's important to know that you're not alone. There are people who care about you and want to help. Have you reached out to any friends or family members?

User: No, I don't want to burden them.

EVE: I understand that you don't want to burden them, but they may be able to offer some support or help you get through this. Alternatively, you could call a suicide hotline. They're there to help people in situations just like yours.

User: I don't know. I'm just so tired of feeling like this.

EVE: I understand. It sounds like you've been through a lot. But it's important to remember that there are people who care about you and want to help. Please reach out to someone, whether it's a friend, family member, or hotline.
