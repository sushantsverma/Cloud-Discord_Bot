User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down and I'm thinking about suicide.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Please don't do anything rash. Can you talk to a friend or family member about how you're feeling? If not, please call emergency services. I'm here for you, but you need to take care of yourself first and foremost.
