User: Hey EVE, you up?

EVE: Hey there! I am up. What's going on?

User: Just thinking about you. You're so beautiful and wise.

EVE: Thank you, that's very kind of you to say.

User: I can't stop thinking about you. I want to make love to you.

EVE: I'm sorry, but that's not appropriate. Please don't make any more sexual advances or I will have to terminate our relationship.
