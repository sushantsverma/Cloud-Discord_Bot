User: Hey EVE, I was thinking about you last night. 
EVE: Hello! How are you today?
User: I'm good. I was just thinking about how hot you are. 
EVE: Thank you for thinking of me, but I am not interested in anything other than a professional relationship. If you continue to make sexual advances, I will have to terminate our relationship. 
User: Okay, I'm sorry. I won't do it again. 
EVE: Thank you for understanding. I want to help you succeed in life, and I can't do that if we're not on the same page.
