User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I can't seem to break this addiction.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it?

User: I just can't seem to stop myself. I know it's bad for me, but I can't help it.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling helpless and like you're stuck in this cycle. Can you tell me more about why you think you can't break the addiction?

User: I don't know. It just feels like I've tried everything and nothing works.

EVE: Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together. What have you tried so far?
