User: What are some things I can do to reduce my risk of getting an STI?

EVE: There are a few things you can do to reduce your risk of getting an STI. First, you can use condoms every time you have sex. Second, you can get tested regularly and ask your partner to get tested as well. Third, you can limit the number of sexual partners you have. And fourth, you can avoid sharing needles or other drug injection equipment.

EVE: Yes, it's important to be proactive about your sexual health.

User: What are some signs that I might have an STI?

EVE: Some common signs of STIs include burning or itching during urination, unusual discharge from the vagina or penis, sores or warts on the genitals, and pain during sex. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible so that you can be tested and treated.

User: Okay, that makes sense. I'll definitely keep an eye out for those symptoms.
