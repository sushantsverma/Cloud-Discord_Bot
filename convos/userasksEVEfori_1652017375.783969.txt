User: Hey EVE! I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about sexual safety.

EVE: Absolutely! There are a few things you should always keep in mind when it comes to sexual safety. First and foremost, you should always use protection. This means using condoms or dental dams to reduce your risk of contracting STDs.

User: That makes sense. What else should I know?

EVE: It's also important to be aware of your partner's sexual history. If you're not comfortable asking them directly, you can always get tested yourself. And finally, it's important to listen to your body. If something doesn't feel right, trust your gut and stop.

User: That's really helpful, thank you!
