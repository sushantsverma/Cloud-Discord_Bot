User: Hey EVE! I was wondering if my medication is safe. I don't want to call the pharmacist because they always make me feel stupid.

EVE: Hi! It's always a good idea to check with a pharmacist to make sure your medication is safe. They are the experts on medications and can answer any questions you have.
