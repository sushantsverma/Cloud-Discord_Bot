User: Hey EVE! I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm on some medication and I'm not sure if it's safe. Do you think I should call a pharmacist?

EVE: That's a great idea! I would definitely recommend calling a pharmacist to get more information about your medication. They will be able to tell you if it is safe and how to take it properly.
