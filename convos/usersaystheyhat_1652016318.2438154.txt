User: Hey EVE! I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Hi! What's up?

User: I hate a certain type of people. I can't stand them and I don't know why. It's like, every time I see them, I just get this feeling of disgust.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about this?

User: I don't know. They're just annoying and I can't stand them.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling with this. Have you tried to talk to anyone about it?

User: No, I don't really want to talk to anyone about it. It's embarrassing.

EVE: I understand. It can be really tough to talk about these things. But it sounds like it's really affecting you. Maybe it would help to talk to someone about it?

User: I don't know...

EVE: It's okay, you don't have to make a decision right now. Just think about it, okay? I'm here for you if you ever want to talk.
