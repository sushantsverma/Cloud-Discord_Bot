User: Hey EVE! I've been struggling lately. I really hate a certain type of people and it's been causing me a lot of stress.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you hate this type of people?

User: They're just really annoying and they always seem to get on my nerves.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Have you tried talking to them to see if you can understand them better?

User: No, I don't really want to talk to them. I just want to stay away from them.

EVE: That's understandable. But sometimes, by talking to people we don't get along with, we can learn more about them and see that they're not so bad after all. Would you be willing to try that?
