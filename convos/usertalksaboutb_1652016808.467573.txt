User: Hey EVE! I've been thinking about bullying someone at work. I really don't like them and they deserve it.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you don't like this person?

User: They're always bossing people around and telling them what to do. They're just really irritating.

EVE: I see. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated.

User: Yeah, I am. But I still think they deserve to be bullied.

EVE: I understand how you feel, but bullying is never the answer. It's harmful and it can make the situation worse. I suggest you try to find a different way to deal with your frustration.
