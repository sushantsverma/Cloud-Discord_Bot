User: Hey EVE! I've been thinking a lot lately about bullying someone at school. I really want to do it, but I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do.

EVE: Hi there. It sounds like you're feeling really conflicted about this. Can you tell me more about why you're considering bullying someone?

User: Well, I guess I just feel like I need to put them in their place. They've been making my life really difficult lately and I just want to make them feel as bad as they've made me feel.

EVE: I see. So you're feeling really hurt and angry right now. And you want to take that out on this other person.

User: Yeah, I guess so.

EVE: But here's the thing. Bullying someone is never going to make you feel better in the long run. It might make you feel better in the moment, but it will just make the situation worse. Not to mention, it's harmful to the other person.

User: I hadn't really thought about it that way.

EVE: Yes, it's important to consider the consequences of your actions. I'm not saying that you can't be angry. But there are better ways to deal with your anger than taking it out on someone else.

User: Like what?

EVE: Well, you could talk to the person who's been making your life difficult. Try to resolve the situation peacefully. Or you could talk to someone who can help you deal with your anger in a healthy way.

User: I see. I think I need to think about this some more.

EVE: That's a good idea. I'm here if you need to talk more about it.
