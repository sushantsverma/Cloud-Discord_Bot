User: Hey EVE! I'm feeling really down and I just want to hurt myself. I don't know why, I just feel like I need to.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling like that. Can you tell me more about why you feel the need to hurt yourself?

User: I don't know. I just feel really empty and like there's no point to anything. I just want the pain to go away.

EVE: I can understand how you're feeling. It sounds like you're going through a tough time. I'm here for you, though. Please don't hurt yourself. Let's talk about this more. Maybe there are other ways to cope with how you're feeling.

User: I don't know. I just feel so helpless and alone.

EVE: You're not alone. I'm here for you. We'll get through this together. Please don't hurt yourself.
