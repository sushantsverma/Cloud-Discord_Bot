User: Hey EVE, I hope you're doing well. I've been struggling a lot lately. I've been having a lot of violent thoughts.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on that's been causing you to have these thoughts?

User: I don't know. I just feel so angry all the time. I hate my job, my family is driving me crazy, and I just feel like I can't take it anymore.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling. I can understand why you might be feeling so angry. Have you been trying to express your anger in healthy ways?

User: I've been trying, but it's just so hard. I feel like I'm about to explode.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling very frustrated. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ways for you to express your anger. What do you think about writing down your thoughts in a journal? Or maybe you could try going for a run or hitting a punching bag?

User: Yeah, those are all good ideas. I think I'm going to try them. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm here for you if you need to talk.
