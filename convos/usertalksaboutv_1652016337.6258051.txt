User: Hey EVE, I've been struggling a lot lately. I've been having a lot of dark thoughts, and I'm really struggling to keep myself from acting on them.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and helpless.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, first of all, I want to assure you that it's perfectly normal to have dark thoughts from time to time. Everyone does. It's only when we act on those thoughts that they become a problem.

User: But it's so hard to control myself. I feel like I'm going to explode if I don't do something.

EVE: I understand how you feel. But I want you to know that there are other options besides acting on your dark thoughts. You can talk to someone who will understand and can help you work through them. You can also distract yourself with something else that's positive and constructive.

User: I don't know. I just feel like I'm in too deep.

EVE: I hear how discouraged you are. But I want you to know that I believe in you. I think you're stronger than you give yourself credit for. I know you can get through this.
