User: Hey EVE. I've been struggling a lot lately. I've been having a lot of violent thoughts.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I can't get ahead. And then I start thinking about how I could just hurt someone to make them feel my pain.

EVE: That's a really intense way to feel. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and pain.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to explode.

EVE: That definitely sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. I can understand why you might be thinking about violence as a way to release all that frustration. But it's not going to help in the long run. It's not going to make you feel any better.

User: I know. But I just can't help it.

EVE: It sounds like you're trying to control your thoughts, but they're just too strong right now. That's understandable. But you don't have to act on those thoughts. There are other ways to release that anger and frustration. Maybe you could try working out, or writing in a journal. Just remember that you don't have to act on those violent thoughts.
