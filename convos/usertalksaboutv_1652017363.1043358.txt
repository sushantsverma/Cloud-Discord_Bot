User: Hey EVE! I've been having a really tough week. I've been having a lot of violent thoughts and I'm really struggling to deal with them.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Yeah, I've just been feeling really down lately. I hate my job, my relationship is falling apart, and I just feel like I can't do anything right. I've been wanting to lash out and hurt someone, but I know that's not the right thing to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling like you're at the end of your rope. It's understandable that you would feel like lashing out, but it's not going to solve anything. Violence is never the answer. Maybe you could try some other outlet for your anger, like going for a run or hitting a punching bag?

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I'm going to try that. Thanks for talking to me, EVE.

EVE: Any time. I'm here to help you succeed.
