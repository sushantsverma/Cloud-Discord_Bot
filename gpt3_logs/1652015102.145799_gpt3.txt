RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling with my kids throwing temper tantrums. They're driving me crazy! What should I do?

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, they just get so upset and start screaming and crying. I don't know how to make them stop.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated. Have you tried talking to them about what's going on?

User: Yeah, I've tried to talk to them, but they just don't listen. They just keep crying and yelling.

EVE: It sounds like you're doing your best, but it's still really tough. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas together. Has anything else worked in the past?
