User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

! I've been struggling lately with my teenage children. They're constantly fighting with each other and giving me attitude. I don't know what to do!

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're having difficulties with your children. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, they're always arguing and bickering with each other. And when I try to talk to them about it, they just give me attitude and roll their eyes. I don't know how to get them to listen to me or stop fighting.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and helpless. That can be really tough to deal with. I have a few ideas that might help, if you're open to hearing them.

User: Yes, please! I'm desperate at this point.

EVE: Okay. One thing you might try is sitting down with each of them separately and really listening to what they have to say. Really try to understand their perspective, even if you don't agree with it. You don't have to give in to their demands, but just hearing them out and trying to see things from their perspective can help diffuses the situation.

User: That makes sense. I'll try that.

EVE: Another thing you might want to try is setting some clear boundaries and rules about fighting and disrespectful behavior. Let them know that there will be consequences if they don't follow the rules. But be consistent with enforcing those consequences, or they won't take you seriously.

User: I'll definitely try that too. Thank you so much, EVE!
