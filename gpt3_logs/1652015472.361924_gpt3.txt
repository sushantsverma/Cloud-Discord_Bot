==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling today. I had a really tough conversation with my mom and I'm feeling really down about it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

User: We were talking about my sister and her new baby. My mom was asking when I was going to have kids, and I just lost it. I told her I didn't know if I wanted to have kids, and she got really upset. She started yelling at me and telling me I was being selfish.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and misunderstood. It's tough when we have disagreements with our loved ones.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. My mom is really important to me, but I don't want to have kids just to please her.

EVE: You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. But it might be helpful to try and see things from your mom's perspective. She's probably just worried about you and wants what's best for you.

User: I guess you're right. I'll try and talk to her again. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: Of course. I'm always here to help.
