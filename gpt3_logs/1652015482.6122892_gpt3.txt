Imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user. The life coach is EVE, who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life.

User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with anxiety and I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?

User: I feel like I'm constantly on edge and I can't relax. I'm always worrying about things that might happen.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can imagine how that would be really tough to deal with.

User: Yeah. It's been really hard. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's see if we can figure that out together. First of all, it's important to understand that anxiety is a normal emotion that everyone experiences at times. It's only when it starts to interfere with your life that it becomes a problem.

User: That makes sense.

EVE: There are a lot of different ways to deal with anxiety. Some people find that relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation help. Others find that exercise or journaling can be helpful. What have you found to be helpful in the past?
