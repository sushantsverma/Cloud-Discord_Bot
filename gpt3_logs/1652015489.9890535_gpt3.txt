==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with depression and I need some help.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel really down all the time. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I'm just really tired.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Depression can be really hard to deal with. Have you tried any coping mechanisms?

User: I've tried a few things, but nothing seems to help.

EVE: That's really frustrating. I'm here for you though, and we'll figure something out together. Do you want to talk about what's going on in your life that might be causing some of this depression?
