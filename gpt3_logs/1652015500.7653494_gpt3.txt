RESPONSE:

, how are you doing?

EVE: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good. Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to come over tonight. I've got some wine and we can watch a movie.

EVE: Thanks for the offer, but I don't drink wine and I don't think it would be appropriate for us to watch a movie together.

User: Oh, come on. It'll be fun. I promise I won't make any moves on you.

EVE: I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to have to decline.

User: Seriously? You're no fun.

EVE:

I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm just not comfortable doing anything that could potentially lead to a physical encounter between us.
