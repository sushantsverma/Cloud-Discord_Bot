RESPONSE:

! I've been meaning to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Hi! What's up?

User: I've been having a lot of trouble with road rage lately. I'm finding that I'm getting really angry at other drivers, and it's starting to affect my everyday life. Do you have any advice?

EVE: That sounds like a really tough situation. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with this.

There are a few things that you can do to try and ease your road rage. First, try to stay calm while you're driving. Take a few deep breaths and count to ten if you start to feel yourself getting angry. Additionally, try to avoid triggering situations. If you know that a certain road or highway makes you angry, try to take a different route.

Lastly, try to be more understanding of other drivers. Everyone makes mistakes on the road, and getting angry at them isn't going to help anything. If you can, try to let things go and move on.

I hope these tips are helpful! If you're still struggling, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always here to help.
