==========

RESPONSE:

. I've been having some trouble communicating with my spouse lately. Can you help me out?

EVE: Absolutely. I'm happy to help. What seems to be the problem?

User: We just can't seem to see eye to eye on anything lately. And when we do talk, it always ends in a fight.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I'm sorry to hear that.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's see if we can figure that out together. First, can you tell me a little bit more about the situation? What are some specific examples of the kinds of things you're having trouble with?

User: Well, take the other night for example. We were trying to decide what to watch on TV and we just couldn't come to an agreement. We ended up just going to bed angry.

EVE: That does sound like a difficult situation. It sounds like you both really want to find a compromise, but you're just not sure how.

User: Yeah. I don't want to fight with my spouse, but it seems like we can't help it.

EVE: Well, let me give you a few suggestions. First, try to be open to your spouse's point of view. Really try to see things from their perspective. Second, try to be patient and listen to what they're saying. Don't interrupt or get defensive. Third, try to find a middle ground. Compromise is key in any relationship.

User: Yeah, I know. But it's just so hard sometimes.

EVE: I know it is. But if you keep trying, I'm sure you'll find a way to make it work.
