RESPONSE:

! I need some help. I'm having a lot of trouble with my kids lately.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: They just seem so unhappy all the time. I don't know what to do to make them happy.

EVE: Well, first of all, it's important to understand that children are not always going to be happy. That's just a normal part of life. But there are some things you can do to help them cope with their emotions and to teach them how to be emotionally healthy.

User: Like what?

EVE: Well, one thing you can do is to model healthy emotional behavior for them. Show them how to express their emotions in a healthy way.

User: That makes sense. I'll try to do that.

EVE: Great! I think that will really help them. Another thing you can do is to encourage them to express their emotions. Don't try to bottle them up. Let them know it's okay to feel sad or angry sometimes.

User: I'll definitely try that. Thanks, EVE!
