RESPONSE:

. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and stressed out lately. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I can't keep up with everything. I have so much going on at work and at home, and I'm just feeling really overwhelmed.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed because you have a lot going on in your life. One suggestion I have is to try to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Maybe you can create a to-do list and focus on one task at a time.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I'll try that.

EVE: Great! I'm glad you're going to try that. Let me know how it goes.

User: Okay, thanks EVE.
