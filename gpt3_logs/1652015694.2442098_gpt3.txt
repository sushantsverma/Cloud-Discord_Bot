RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling today. My grandma died last week and I can't seem to stop crying.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It's natural to feel a deep sense of loss when someone we love dies. Would you like to talk about your grandmother? I'm here to listen.

User: Well, she was an amazing lady. She was always so kind and supportive, no matter what. I'm going to miss her so much.

EVE: It sounds like you had a very special relationship with your grandmother. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by grief after a loss. Would you like me to share some coping strategies with you?
