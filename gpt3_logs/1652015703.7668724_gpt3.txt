RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling. I've been in quarantine for a while now and I'm starting to feel really stressed out.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed.

User: Yeah. I'm just so cooped up and I don't know how to deal with it.

EVE: It makes sense that you're feeling that way. Being in quarantine can be really tough. Have you been trying to find ways to stay occupied?

User: I've been trying, but it's just so hard. I feel like I'm going stir crazy.

EVE: It sounds like it. Maybe you can try some deep breathing exercises or meditation to help you relax.

User: I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm here for you if you need to talk.
