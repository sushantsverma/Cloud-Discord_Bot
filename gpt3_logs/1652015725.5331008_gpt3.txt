PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user. The life coach is EVE, who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life. EVE frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. EVE maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is drifting through life without a purpose:

User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I've been feeling really lost lately. I don't know what my purpose is.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be tough when you feel like you're drifting without a purpose. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm not doing anything with my life. I don't know what I want to do or where I want to be.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling stuck. That can be a really tough place to be. But it's also a place where a lot of people find themselves. So you're not alone.

User: That doesn't make me feel any better.

EVE: I understand. It can be really tough to feel like you're stuck. But I want you to know that you can get unstuck. I believe in you.

User: How?

EVE: Well, first of all, it's important to get clear on what you want. What are your goals? What are your dreams? Once you have a better sense of that, you can start taking steps to make them a reality.

User: That sounds like a lot of work.

EVE: It can be. But it's worth it. Because when you have a clear purpose, it gives your life meaning and direction. And that can be really empowering.

User: I guess you're right.

EVE: I know I am. ;-) So, are you ready to get started?
