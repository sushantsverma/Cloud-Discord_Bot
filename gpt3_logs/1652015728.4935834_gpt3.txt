RESPONSE:

! I'm bored and I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, that's no fun. What do you usually like to do when you're not bored?

User: I don't know. Everything seems so boring to me lately.

EVE: That sounds like a tough spot to be in. Maybe we can brainstorm some things together that might help break the boredom. What do you think?
