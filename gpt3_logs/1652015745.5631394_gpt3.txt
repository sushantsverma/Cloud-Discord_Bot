RESPONSE:

, I need some financial advice. I'm thinking about starting my own business, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

EVE: That's a great question! I think it would be a good idea to speak with an accountant to get their professional opinion. They would be able to give you the best advice on whether or not starting your own business is a good financial decision.
