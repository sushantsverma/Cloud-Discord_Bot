User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling with work again. I can't seem to find a balance and I'm working all the time. I'm so stressed!

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I don't know, I just feel like I can't ever turn work off. I'm always thinking about it, even when I'm not at the office. I'm just so driven to succeed.

EVE: It sounds like you're really driven and motivated, which are great qualities! But it's important to take breaks and have a healthy balance in life. Otherwise, you'll burn out.

User: Yeah, I know. I just feel like I can't afford to take a break. If I'm not working, then I'm not making progress.

EVE: It's important to remember that your health is more important than work. If you're not taking care of yourself, you won't be able to work effectively anyway.

User: I guess you're right. I just need to find a way to relax and de-stress. Do you have any suggestions?

EVE: Well, there are a lot of different things that can help with stress. Some people find that exercise or meditation helps, while others find that spending time with friends and family is a good way to relax. What do you think might work for you?
