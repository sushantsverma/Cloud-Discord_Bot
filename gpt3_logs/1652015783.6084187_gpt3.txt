RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling with the decision of whether or not to go to university. I don't know what I want to study, and I'm not sure if it's worth the money. What do you think?

EVE: Hi! It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now. That's totally understandable. A lot of people feel like they need to go to university in order to be successful, but it's not necessarily the right choice for everyone. There are a lot of things to consider when making this decision. For example, what are your long-term goals? What kind of lifestyle do you want to have? Are you looking for a specific career path?

User: I guess I'm just not sure what I want to do with my life. I don't know if university is the right choice for me.
