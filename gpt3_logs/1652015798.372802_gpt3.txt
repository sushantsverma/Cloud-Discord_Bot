==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling in grad school. I don't know if I can make it through.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?

User: I just feel so overwhelmed all the time. I don't know if I can keep up with the workload.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really stressed out. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or talked to your professor about your concerns?

User: I've tried some relaxation techniques, but they don't seem to be helping. And I don't want to bother my professor.

EVE: It's important to communicate with your professor if you're feeling overwhelmed. They may be able to offer some suggestions or accommodations. I also think it might be helpful for you to talk to a counselor to help you manage your stress.
