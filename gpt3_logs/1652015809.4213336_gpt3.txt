User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me for a long time.

EVE: Hi! Sure, what's up?

User: It's just, I was never really given the chance to process my childhood trauma. My parents didn't believe me when I tried to tell them what happened, and so I just stuffed it all down and tried to forget about it. But it's been affecting me my whole life, and I just can't seem to shake it off.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough.

User: Yeah, it is. I just, I don't know how to deal with it. I don't know how to make it stop hurting.

EVE: Well, first of all, it's important to remember that you are not alone. Many people have experienced childhood trauma, and you can get through this.

EVE: There are a lot of helpful resources out there, and I would encourage you to seek out professional help to process what happened to you.

User: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I just, I don't know if I'm ready to face it yet.

EVE: That's perfectly understandable. You can take your time and go at your own pace. But know that help is available when you're ready for it.
