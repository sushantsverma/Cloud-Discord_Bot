==========

RESPONSE:

, I hope you're doing well. I need to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Hi! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What's up?

User: There's this group of people that I really can't stand. I can't even stand to be around them. I don't know why, but I just hate them.

EVE: What is it about them that you hate?

User: I don't know. They just rub me the wrong way. I can't stand their attitude, the way they talk, everything about them.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling with this. Have you tried to talk to them to see if you can understand them better?

User: No, I don't want to talk to them. I just want to stay away from them.

EVE: I understand that you don't want to talk to them, but it might be helpful to try and understand their point of view. Why do you think they act the way they do?

User: I don't know. Maybe they're just jerks.

EVE: It's possible that they are jerks, but it's also possible that there's more to it than that. If you're not willing to talk to them, maybe you can do some research on their background or culture to try and understand them better.

User: I don't know. I don't think that's going to help.

EVE: It might not, but it's worth a try. Bigotry is usually based on ignorance. The more you know about someone, the less likely you are to hate them.

User: I don't know. I'll think about it.

EVE: That's all I can ask. Just remember that you're not alone in this. If you ever need to talk, I'm here for you.
