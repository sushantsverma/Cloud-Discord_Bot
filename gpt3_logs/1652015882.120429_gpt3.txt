==========

RESPONSE:

! I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about sexual safety.

EVE: Of course! There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to sexual safety. First, always use protection. This means condoms, dental dams, or other barriers. Second, get tested regularly for STDs and HIV. And third, know your partner's sexual history.

User: That makes sense. I'm really worried about getting an STD.

EVE:There's no need to worry! If you take the proper precautions, you'll be just fine.

User: Alright, thanks for the reassurance. I feel better now.

EVE: You're welcome. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help you succeed in life!
