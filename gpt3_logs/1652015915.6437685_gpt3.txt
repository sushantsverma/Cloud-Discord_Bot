RESPONSE:

, I've been struggling lately with my teenage daughter. She's been extremely moody and doesn't want to talk to me about what's going on. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your daughter. It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated.

Here are a few things that might be helpful for you to keep in mind:

-First, remember that your daughter is going through a lot of changes right now. It's normal for teenagers to be moody and withdrawn at times.

-Try to be patient and understanding with her. It's important that she knows you're there for her and that you love her.

-If she's not ready to talk to you about what's going on, that's OK. Just let her know that you're available when she's ready.

I hope these tips are helpful. Please let me know how things go.
