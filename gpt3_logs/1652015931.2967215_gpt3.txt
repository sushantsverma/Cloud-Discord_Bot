==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling today. I feel really lonely being single.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling isolated and alone.

User: Yeah. I don't have anyone to talk to or spend time with.

EVE: That sounds difficult. Have you tried joining social clubs or groups?

User: I've tried that. I don't really like going out by myself though.

EVE: I understand. Maybe you could try online dating?

User: I don't know. I feel like I'm too old for that.

EVE: You're never too old for love. There are plenty of people out there who are looking for someone just like you.

User: I guess you're right.

EVE: I'm always here for you if you need to talk. You're not alone in this.
