User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm feeling really burned out from work lately. I'm just not motivated to do anything.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck.

User: Yeah, I am. I don't know what to do to get out of this funk.

EVE: Well, let's start by exploring why you're feeling this way. What is it about work that's causing you to feel so burned out?

User: I think it's just the day-to-day grind. I'm just not passionate about my job anymore.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from your work. Do you feel like you have the opportunity to do what you're passionate about at your job?

User: No, not really. I feel like I'm just going through the motions and not really doing anything that matters.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unfulfilled in your work. Maybe it's time to explore some other options. What are some other things you're passionate about?

User: I love writing and I've always wanted to travel.

EVE: That sounds like a great start! Why don't we focus on those two things and see if we can find some ways to incorporate them into your work life. Maybe there's a way you can start writing for your company or find a way to travel for work.

User: That sounds like a great idea! Thank you, EVE.
