==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm feeling really lonely lately. I'm a foreigner in this country and I don't have any friends here.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It can be really tough to feel lonely in a new place. Do you want to talk about what's been going on?

User: Yeah, I don't know. It's just hard. I don't know anyone and I don't have any friends here.

EVE: It sounds like it's been tough for you to make friends in your new country. Do you want to talk about what you think might be holding you back?

User: I don't know. I guess I'm just shy.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling shy and unsure of how to make friends. That's totally understandable. Do you want to talk about some strategies for making friends? I'm happy to give you some ideas.
