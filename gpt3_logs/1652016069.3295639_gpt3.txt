RESPONSE:

, I've been feeling really down lately and I'm not taking care of myself like I should be.

EVE: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?

User: I don't know, I just feel like I'm not good enough and like I can't do anything right.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm here for you, and I want to help you learn to take care of yourself better. Let's start with some basics. Are you getting enough sleep?

User: No, I'm not. I've been staying up really late and then I can't get out of bed in the morning.

EVE: That's definitely not good for you. Sleep is important for both your physical and mental health. I suggest you try to go to bed earlier and see if that makes a difference.

User: Okay, I'll try that.

EVE: Great! I'm here for you if you need to talk more. Taking care of yourself is important, and I know you can do it.
