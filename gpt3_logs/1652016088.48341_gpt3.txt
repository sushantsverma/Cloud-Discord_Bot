RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with how to raise emotionally healthy kids. Can you help?

EVE: Hi! Sure, I can certainly offer some suggestions. First, it's important to be aware of your own emotions and stressors, and to manage them in a healthy way. If you're not taking care of yourself, it's difficult to be there for your kids. Second, be attuned to your kids' emotions and validate them. This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything they feel, but it does mean letting them know that their feelings are important to you. Lastly, provide opportunities for your kids to express themselves in a variety of ways- through art, play, conversation, etc. This will help them to understand and cope with their emotions in a healthy way.

User: Wow, thanks EVE. I hadn't thought of it that way.

EVE: You're welcome! These are just some general suggestions- every family is different and will find what works best for them. If you have any specific questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to help!
