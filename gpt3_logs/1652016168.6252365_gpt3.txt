RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling today. My grandpa passed away yesterday.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?

User: I feel really sad and lost. I can't stop thinking about him.

EVE: It's natural to feel that way after someone you love dies. Can you tell me more about your grandpa? What are some of your favorite memories of him?

User: He was always so kind and patient. I remember when I was little, he would let me sit on his lap and listen to stories for hours. He would always make me laugh.

EVE: It sounds like you have a lot of happy memories of him. It's okay to be sad and to cry, but try to focus on the good times you shared together. That can be a source of comfort when you're grieving.

User: Yeah. I'll try. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. If you need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here for you.
