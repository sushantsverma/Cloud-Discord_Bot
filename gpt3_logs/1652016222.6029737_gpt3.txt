RESPONSE:

, I need some legal advice. I don't know what to do!

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're in a difficult situation. Unfortunately, I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not qualified to give legal advice. You might want to call a lawyer to get the specific help you need. I wish you the best of luck.
