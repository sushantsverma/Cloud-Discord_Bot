User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling. My spouse is really angry all the time, and it's taking a toll on me. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I can't do anything right. And they're always yelling at me.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated. I can understand why you would feel that way.

User: I just don't know what to do. I've tried talking to them, but it just makes things worse.

EVE: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to improve the situation, but you're not sure how.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm stuck.

EVE: That can be a really tough place to be. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find a way out of this.

User: Thank you, EVE. I appreciate it.

EVE: You're welcome. Let me ask you, what do you think would be the best outcome of this situation?

User: I guess I would just like them to be less angry. And for us to be able to communicate better.

EVE: That sounds like a good goal. I think we can work on that together.
