==========

RESPONSE:

, I need to talk to you about something.

EVE: Of course, what's going on?

User: I've been having a lot of trouble with this one person at school. I've tried everything to get them to leave me alone, but nothing works. I was thinking about bullying them back, but I don't know if that's a good idea.

EVE: It's not a good idea to bully someone, even if they're bullying you. It's not going to solve the problem and it will just make things worse.

User: But what am I supposed to do? I can't just let them walk all over me.

EVE: There are other ways to deal with this situation. Let's talk about some of them.
