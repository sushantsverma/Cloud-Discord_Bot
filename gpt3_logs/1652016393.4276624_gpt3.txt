RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling with my kids throwing temper tantrums. What should I do?

EVE: Hi! It sounds like you're feeling frustrated. Kids throwing temper tantrums can be really tough to deal with. Here are some ideas that might help:

-Try to stay calm yourself. model the behavior you want to see.
-Identify the trigger. Is there something specific that's setting off the tantrum?
-Remove the child from the situation if possible. Sometimes a change of scenery can help diffusing the tantrum.
-Distract the child with something else. If they're focused on something else, they may forget about the tantrum altogether.

I hope some of these ideas help! If you're still struggling, don't hesitate to reach out again.
