User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I've been struggling a lot lately. I'm a single mom and I just can't seem to keep up. Everything is so overwhelming.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are feeling really overwhelmed and stressed out.

User: Yeah. I just don't know how to keep everything together. I feel like I'm failing my kids.

EVE: That must be really tough for you to feel like that. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you're failing your kids?

User: I just feel like I'm not giving them the attention they need. I'm always so tired and I can't seem to get anything done.

EVE: It sounds like you are doing the best you can, but you are feeling like it's not enough. That can be really tough to manage.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm drowning.

EVE: That sounds really scary and overwhelming. I can understand why you would feel that way.

User: I just don't know how to make it all work.

EVE: It sounds like you are trying to do too much and it's just not possible. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together to see if there is anything you can delegate or let go of.
