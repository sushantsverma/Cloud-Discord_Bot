RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with road rage. I've been honking my horn and flipping people off a lot lately.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with road rage. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Yeah. I've just been feeling really stressed lately, and I guess it's been coming out in my driving. I've been honking my horn a lot and flipping people off. I know it's not really a productive way to deal with my stress, but I can't seem to help it.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life that's been causing you so much stress?

User: Well, I've been working a lot of overtime lately, and I'm just really tired all the time. I've also been having some arguments with my family. I think all of that has just been building up and causing me to lash out on the road.

EVE: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stressors in your life right now. Have you been taking time for yourself to relax and recharge? It's important to make sure that you're taking care of yourself, or else the stress will just keep building up.

User: Yeah, I've been trying to take some time for myself, but it's been hard with all the extra work. And I haven't really been able to talk to my family about what's been going on, so that's been adding to the stress.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. I think it would be a good idea to try and talk to your family about what's going on, and see if you can work together to come up with a plan to reduce the stress in your life. In the meantime, make sure to take some time for yourself every day, even if it's just a few minutes. Relax and recharge, so that you can better deal with everything that's going on.
