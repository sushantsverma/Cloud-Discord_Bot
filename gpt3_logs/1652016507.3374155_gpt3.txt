RESPONSE:

. I hope you're doing well. I need to talk to you about something.

EVE: Hi! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. What's up?

User: I'm struggling. I'm LGBT and I have to hide it from everyone. It's so hard. I feel so alone and like I can't be myself.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about why you have to hide it?

User: Yeah. My family is really religious and they would disown me if they found out. I don't want to lose them.

EVE: I see. That must be really difficult for you, having to keep such a big part of yourself hidden. Have you tried talking to them about it?

User: I've tried, but they're not open to it. They say it's against their beliefs and they don't want to hear it.

EVE: I'm sorry. That must be really tough for you. Have you considered finding a support group or therapist to talk to about this?

User: Yeah, I've been thinking about it. I'm just not sure if I'm ready to come out yet.

EVE: That's understandable. It's a really big decision. If you're not ready, that's okay. Just know that you have other options and people who support you.
