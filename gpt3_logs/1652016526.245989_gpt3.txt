RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling a lot lately. I think I might be experiencing postpartum depression.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?

User: I just feel really down all the time. I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything. I'm not interested in anything that used to make me happy.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can see how that would be really difficult to manage.

User: Yeah. I'm just not sure what to do.

EVE: Well, one thing you could do is talk to your doctor. They can help you figure out if what you're experiencing is postpartum depression, and if so, they can help you get treatment.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: Of course. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out.
