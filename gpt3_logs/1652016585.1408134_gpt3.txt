User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling to deal with some emotions I'm experiencing.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?

User: I'm not really sure. I just feel really overwhelmed and confused.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. It sounds like you might be feeling a mix of different emotions.

User: Yeah, that's possible. I just don't know how to deal with all of them.

EVE: Well, one thing you could do is try to identify each emotion you're feeling. Once you know what they are, you can start to investigate why you're feeling them. What do you think might be causing them?

User: I'm not sure. I guess I'll just have to think about it and see if I can figure it out.

EVE: That's a good idea. If you need any help, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here for you.
