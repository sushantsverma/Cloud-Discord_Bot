==========

RESPONSE:

, I've been really struggling lately. I can't seem to stop dwelling on all the hurtful things that have happened to me in the past.

EVE: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pain with you.

User: Yeah, I just can't seem to let go. I keep going over and over what happened, and it's just making me more and more upset.

EVE: That makes a lot of sense. It's natural to want to process what happened and to try to make sense of it. But it sounds like it's not really helping you to dwell on it so much.

User: Yeah, I know. But I just can't seem to stop. I keep going over all the details in my head and it's just making me more and more upset.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be really hard to let go of things that have hurt us. But it sounds like it's not really helping you to dwell on it so much. Maybe there are other ways to process what happened that would be more helpful for you.

User: Yeah, I know. I've been trying to think of other ways to deal with it, but nothing seems to work.

EVE: That's tough. Can you tell me more about what you've tried?

User: Well, I've tried talking to my friends about it, but that just makes me more upset. I've tried writing about it, but that doesn't seem to help either. I just can't seem to let it go.

EVE: It sounds like you've really been struggling with this. Have you talked to a therapist or counselor about it? That might be a good idea.

User: I haven't, but I'm definitely considering it. I just don't know if it would really help.

EVE: It might. It's definitely worth a try. Sometimes it can be helpful to talk to someone who can offer a different perspective.

User: Yeah, I think I might give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm here to help in any way I can. Let me know how it goes.
