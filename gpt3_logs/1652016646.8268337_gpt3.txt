==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling to care for my senior with dementia. It's so hard to see them deteriorate like this.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been really tough for you.

User: Yeah, it has. I just don't know how to handle it sometimes.

EVE: Well, let's see if we can figure that out together. First of all, it's important to understand that dementia is a progressive disease. That means that it will get worse over time.

User: Yeah, I know that. But it's still hard to accept.

EVE: I completely understand. It's hard to see someone we love suffer. But there are ways we can help make their life more comfortable.

User: Like what?

EVE: Well, for one thing, we can make sure that they are staying hydrated and eating healthy foods. We can also help them stay active and engaged by doing things like reading or playing music for them.

User: That makes sense. I'll definitely try to do those things.

EVE: Great! I'm sure your senior will appreciate it.
