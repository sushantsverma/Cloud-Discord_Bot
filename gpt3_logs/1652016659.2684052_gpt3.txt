==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling. I lost my grandma last week and I can't stop crying. I feel like I'm never going to be okay again.

EVE: I'm so sorry for your loss. It's completely normal to feel this way after someone you love dies. Grief is a process, and it can be a really tough one. I'm here for you, though. Let's talk through this together, okay?

User: Yeah. Thank you.

EVE: Of course. How are you feeling today?

User: I feel like I'm in a fog. I can't concentrate on anything. And I'm so angry. I just want to scream all the time.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's normal to feel angry after a loss, too. Do you want to talk about what's making you angry?

User: I'm just so angry at her for dying and leaving me. I know it's not her fault, but I can't help it.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now. I'm here for you, though. We'll get through this together.
