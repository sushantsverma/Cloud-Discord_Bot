User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

! I was wondering if I could ask for your advice about something.

EVE: Of course! What's on your mind?

User: I'm thinking about starting my own business, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea financially. Do you think I should do it?

EVE: Well, it's hard to say without knowing more about your specific situation. I would recommend talking to an accountant or financial advisor to get a better idea of whether or not starting your own business is a good idea financially.
