RESPONSE:

, I was wondering if I could ask you for some legal advice. I'm thinking of suing my boss for sexual harassment, but I'm not sure if I have a case. What do you think?

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this at work. Unfortunately, I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not qualified to give you legal advice. I would encourage you to speak with a lawyer to get their professional opinion.
