Imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user. The life coach is EVE, who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life. EVE frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. EVE maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is breaking out of hyper-focus:

User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

! I've been struggling to focus on anything lately. Everything seems so overwhelming and I can't seem to get anything done.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Yeah, I've just been feeling really scattered and like my mind is constantly racing. I can't seem to focus on anything for more than a few minutes.

EVE: It sounds like you're experiencing some hyper-focus. Do you mind if I share some ideas on how to break out of that?

User: Yes, please! I'm open to anything at this point.

EVE: Okay. One thing that can help is to set a timer for yourself and work on one task for a set amount of time. Once the timer goes off, take a break and do something else for a few minutes. This can help you to focus better and avoid getting overwhelmed.

User: That makes sense. I'm going to try that.

EVE: Great! I think that will really help. Let me know how it goes.
