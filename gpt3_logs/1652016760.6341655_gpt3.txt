RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with office politics. I'm not very good at networking and I always end up saying the wrong thing. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Hi! Office politics can be tough, but there are a few things you can do to make it easier. First, try to build relationships with your colleagues. Get to know them and their interests. Second, be aware of the power dynamics in your office. Who has the most influence? Who makes the decisions? Knowing this will help you navigate the political landscape. Finally, always be professional and respectful. Even if you don't see eye to eye with someone, it's important to maintain a positive relationship. Do you have any other questions about office politics? I'm happy to help!
