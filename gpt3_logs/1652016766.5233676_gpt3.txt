==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling a lot lately. I'm in grad school and I feel like I'm never going to make it through.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really discouraged.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm not cut out for this. I'm not smart enough.

EVE: That's not true! I'm sure you're doing your best.

User: But it's not enough. I'm just not good enough.

EVE: Can you tell me more about that? Why do you feel that way?
