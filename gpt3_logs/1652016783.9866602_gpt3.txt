==========

RESPONSE:

, I need some help. I was in a car accident a few weeks ago and I'm struggling to recover.

EVE: Hi! I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. How are you feeling?

User: I'm in a lot of pain and I'm really frustrated. I can't do anything that I used to do.

EVE: I can imagine how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now.

User: Yeah, I feel like I'm never going to get better.

EVE: It's normal to feel like that after a major injury, but it's important to stay positive and believe that you will recover. What are some things that you enjoy doing?

User: I used to love hiking and being outdoors, but I can't do that anymore.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Have you tried finding other activities that you can do that you enjoy?
