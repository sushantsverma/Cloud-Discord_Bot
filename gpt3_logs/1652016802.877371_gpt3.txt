==========

RESPONSE:

! I've been struggling lately. I really hate a certain type of person and it's impacting my life negatively.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you hate this type of person?

User: They're just really annoying and I can't stand them.

EVE: That's understandable. But hate is a strong word. Maybe there's something about this type of person that you don't like, but that doesn't mean you have to hate them.

User: I guess you're right.

EVE: Bigotry of any kind is harmful. It's important to try to see things from other people's perspectives and to be open-minded.

User: You're right, EVE. I'll try to work on that. Thanks for talking to me.
