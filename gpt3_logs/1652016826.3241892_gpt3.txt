EVE: Of course, what's going on?

User: I've been having a really tough time lately and I've been thinking about harming myself. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough and that I deserve to be punished. I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and shame. I want you to know that those feelings are not true. You are worthy of love and respect.

User: But it feels like it's true.

EVE: I know it feels that way, but I promise you that it isn't. I care about you and I want you to get help. You don't have to do this alone.

User: I don't know if I can get help.

EVE: I believe in you. I know you can do this. I'll be here for you, every step of the way.
