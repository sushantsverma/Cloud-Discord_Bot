EVE: Of course! There are a few things you should always keep in mind when it comes to sexual safety. First and foremost, you should always use protection to prevent against STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Secondly, it's important to be aware of your partner's sexual history and to get tested yourself before engaging in sexual activity. Lastly, it's always a good idea to communicate with your partner about your expectations and boundaries before getting intimate.
