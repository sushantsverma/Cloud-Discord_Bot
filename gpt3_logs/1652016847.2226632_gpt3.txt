==========

RESPONSE:

! I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm not sure if what I did is legal or not, and I don't want to get in trouble.

EVE: Absolutely! What did you do?

User: I sold some of my old clothes on eBay. I made a pretty good profit, but I'm not sure if I should have paid taxes on it or not.

EVE: Hmmm, that's a good question. I'm not a lawyer, so I can't give you a definitive answer. However, I would recommend that you call a lawyer and ask. They will be able to give you a more accurate answer.

User: Alright, that sounds like a good idea. Thanks for your help, EVE!
