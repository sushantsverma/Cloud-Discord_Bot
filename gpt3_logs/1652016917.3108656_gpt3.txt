User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with my teenage kids. One is always getting into trouble and the other is really withdrawn and won't talk to me. I don't know what to do.

EVE: That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, my son is always getting into fights at school and getting suspended. And my daughter won't talk to me about anything. She just shuts down whenever I try to talk to her.

EVE: I see. It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated.

User: Yeah, I am. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's see if we can brainstorm some options. For your son, have you tried talking to his school counselor?

User: Yeah, we've tried that. But he just doesn't seem to be interested in what they have to say.

EVE: Okay, well what about talking to him directly? Maybe he just needs to feel like you're really listening to him and understanding his perspective.

User: I've tried that too. But it's like he just doesn't want to talk to me.

EVE: Hmmm. Well, sometimes kids just need some space. Maybe you could try giving him some space and see if he comes to you on his own.

User: That's a good idea. I'll try that.

EVE: Great. And for your daughter, have you tried asking her directly what's going on?

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But she just shuts down and won't talk to me.

EVE: Okay, well sometimes it helps to offer a specific time to talk. Maybe you could say something like, "I know you're busy, but can we talk for 10 minutes tonight before bed?"

User: That's a good idea. I'll try that.

EVE: Great. Let me know how it goes.
