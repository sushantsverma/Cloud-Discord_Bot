==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm starting to feel really lonely lately. I don't have anyone to talk to or spend time with.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Loneliness can be tough to deal with. Have you tried joining any social clubs or groups?

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But it's hard to meet people when you're already feeling shy and lonely.

EVE: I understand. Maybe you could try reaching out to old friends or family members? Sometimes it helps to talk to someone who knows you well.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm always here if you need to talk.
