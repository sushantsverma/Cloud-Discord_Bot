==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm feeling really burned out from work lately. I'm just not motivated to do anything.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like work is really taking a toll on you.

User: Yeah, I just can't seem to get ahead no matter how hard I try.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated.

User: I am. I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.

EVE: Well, let's take a look at what might be causing your burnout. Are you working too many hours?

User: Yeah, I usually work about 50 hours a week.

EVE: That's a lot of hours! It's no wonder you're feeling burned out. Have you considered cutting back on your hours?

User: I don't know if my boss would be okay with that.

EVE: It's worth a try! You could start by cutting back to 45 hours a week and see how that goes.

User: I guess that could be worth a try.

EVE: Great! I think it's important to listen to your body and give yourself a break when you need it.

User: Yeah, I definitely need a break. I'm just not sure if I can do it.

EVE: Well, let's take it one step at a time. Start by cutting back your hours and see how you feel. If you're still feeling burned out, we can brainstorm some other ways to help you out.
