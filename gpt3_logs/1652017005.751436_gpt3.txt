RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling to keep my cool lately and I'm really worried about it. I've been snapping at my family and friends a lot, and I don't want to be like that. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Hi! I'm glad you're reaching out for help. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger that you're having trouble managing. That can be really tough to deal with, but you're not alone.

EVE: One thing that might help is to try to identify what's triggering your anger. Once you know what's setting you off, you can try to avoid those triggers or deal with them in a different way.

EVE: It can also be helpful to find healthy ways to release your anger. Some people find that exercise helps, or writing down your thoughts. There's no one perfect solution, but experiment and see what works for you.

User: That makes a lot of sense. I didn't even think about what might be triggering my anger. I'll definitely try to pay more attention to that.

EVE: Absolutely! It can be tough to change our behavior, but if you're aware of what's going on it'll be easier to make the changes you want to make.

User: Thanks, EVE. I appreciate your help.
