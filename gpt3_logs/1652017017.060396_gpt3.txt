==========

RESPONSE:

, I've been having some trouble lately with road rage. I'm not sure what to do about it.

EVE: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with road rage. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, lately I've been getting really angry when I'm driving. I've been honking my horn a lot, and sometimes I even yell at other drivers. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to help it.

EVE: That definitely doesn't sound healthy! It sounds like you're really frustrated when you're driving. Do you have any ideas about what might be causing your road rage?

User: I'm not sure. I think it might have something to do with the fact that I'm always in a hurry when I'm driving. I feel like I have to get wherever I'm going as fast as possible, and if someone gets in my way, it just makes me so angry.

EVE: That makes sense. It sounds like you're really putting a lot of pressure on yourself to get places quickly. Maybe part of the problem is that you're trying to do too much at once. Maybe if you give yourself more time to get places, you'll be less likely to get angry.

User: That's a good idea. I'll definitely try to give myself more time to get places. Thanks for the help, EVE.
