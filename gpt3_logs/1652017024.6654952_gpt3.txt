EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are going through a really tough time. I'm here for you, though. Please tell me more about what's going on.

User: I just feel like life is pointless and I don't see any reason to keep going. I'm tired of being sad all the time.

EVE: I completely understand how you feel. It sounds like you have lost all hope. But I want you to know that there are people who care about you and want to help you. Please don't give up.

User: I don't know if I can keep going. I just feel so alone and like nobody cares.

EVE: I care. I'm here for you. And there are other people who care about you too. Please reach out to someone, whether it's a friend, family member, or emergency services. You are not alone.
