==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling a lot lately. I moved to a new country a few months ago and I'm really struggling to make friends. I feel so lonely all the time.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be really tough to feel lonely in a new place. Have you been reaching out to people and trying to make connections?

User: Yeah, I've been going to some meetups and stuff. But it's just not the same as having close friends.

EVE: Yeah, I can imagine. It sounds like you're really feeling the loss of your old friends and support system.

User: Yeah. I just don't know how to make new friends here. Everyone seems so busy and it's just so different from my home country.

EVE: It can definitely be challenging to make friends in a new place. Have you tried joining any clubs or groups that align with your interests?

User: Yeah, I've tried that too. I just don't know if I'll ever feel like I belong here.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It sounds like you're feeling really lost and alone right now.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas. Maybe there are some activities you can do that will help you feel more connected to people and to your new home. What do you like to do for fun?
