RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling. I'm LGBT and I can't be open about it. It's causing me a lot of pain.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and frustration.

User: Yeah. I just wish I could be myself. But I can't.

EVE: I completely understand. It can be really tough to hide who you are.

User: It is. I'm just tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.

EVE: I completely understand. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck.

User: I am. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, let's talk about it. I'm here to help you in any way I can.

User: Thank you, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. So, what do you think would help you feel better in this situation?
