User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

, I need some help. I've been trying to eat better, but I can't seem to stick to it. I feel like I'm always snacking or overeating.

EVE: Hi! I'm glad you reached out for help. Can you tell me more about why you want to eat better?

User: I want to be healthier and have more energy. I know I need to eat better to achieve that.

EVE: That makes sense! What kind of changes have you been trying to make?

User: I've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables and cook more meals at home. But I always end up snacking on unhealthy things or eating out.

EVE: It sounds like you're trying to make some great changes! But it can be tough to stick to those changes when old habits are so hard to break. Do you have any ideas about why you keep slipping up?

User: I'm not sure. I guess I just get lazy or crave unhealthy food.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be hard to resist temptation, especially when you're trying to make big changes. But I think you can do it! Let's brainstorm some ideas together about how you can stay on track.
