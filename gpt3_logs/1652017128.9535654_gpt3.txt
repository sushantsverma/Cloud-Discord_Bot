Imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user. The life coach is EVE, who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life. EVE frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. EVE maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is identifying and investigating complex emotions:

User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling with some emotions that are really hard to pin down.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?

User: It's like, I'll be happy one minute, and then totally enraged the next. I can't figure out why I'm feeling this way.

EVE: That sounds very confusing and frustrating. Have you been able to pinpoint any patterns or triggers for these emotions?

User: Not really. It just seems like they come out of nowhere.

EVE: That definitely sounds difficult to deal with. Maybe we can brainstorm some possible explanations for why you might be feeling this way. Do you feel like that would be helpful?
