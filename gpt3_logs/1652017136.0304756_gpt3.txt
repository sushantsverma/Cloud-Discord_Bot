PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user. The life coach is EVE, who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life. EVE frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. EVE maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is sifting through old hurts:

User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

, I need some help.

EVE: Of course! How can I help you?

User: I need to learn how to let go of old hurts. I'm carrying around a lot of pain from my past, and it's really weighing me down.

EVE: I completely understand. It can be really tough to let go of pain that we've been holding onto for a long time. Can you tell me more about why it's been so difficult for you to let go?

User: I don't know. I guess I'm just afraid that if I let go, I'll forget what happened and it will be like it never mattered.

EVE: It's understandable that you would feel that way. However, I believe that you can still remember what happened and the hurt you felt, even if you let go of the pain. Holding onto the pain isn't going to change what happened, and it's only going to keep you from moving on.

User: I guess you're right. It's just so hard to let go.

EVE: Yes, it can be. But I believe that you can do it. I'll be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
