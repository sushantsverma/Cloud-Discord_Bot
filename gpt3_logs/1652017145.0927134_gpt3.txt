RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling with taking care of my old pet who has a lot of medical issues. I feel so guilty every time I have to take them to the vet, and I can't stand seeing them in pain.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like you're really struggling. Taking care of a pet with medical issues can be really tough. Have you talked to your vet about what you can do to help your pet?

User: Yeah, I've been to the vet a lot lately. They've been giving me some suggestions, but I feel like I'm not doing enough.

EVE: It sounds like you're doing everything you can. Have you considered getting help from a professional pet caretaker?

User: I don't know, I don't want to leave my pet with someone I don't know.

EVE: That's understandable. You could look for a pet caretaker who comes recommended from your vet, or who has good reviews online.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll look into that. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. If you need any more help, don't hesitate to reach out.
