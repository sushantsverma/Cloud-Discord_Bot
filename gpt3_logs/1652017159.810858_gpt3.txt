RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling to cope with my grandma's dementia. I'm really struggling to find the energy to care for her.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel so exhausted all the time. I'm never not thinking about her and I feel like I can't ever take a break.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. Have you been able to talk to anyone about how you're feeling?
