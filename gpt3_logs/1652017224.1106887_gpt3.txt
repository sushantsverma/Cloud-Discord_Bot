User: Hey EVE

==========

RESPONSE:

! I hope you're doing well. I'm struggling a bit right now.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm drifting through life without a purpose. I don't know what I want to do with my life.

EVE: That can be a really tough feeling. Can you tell me more about that?

User: I just feel like I'm not doing anything that matters. I don't know what my passions are or what I want to achieve.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling lost right now. That's understandable. A lot of people feel like that at some point in their lives.

EVE: One thing that might help is to think about what you're good at. What are you proud of that you've accomplished?

User: I don't know. I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.

EVE: Everyone has accomplishments, even if they don't feel like they're big ones. What are some things you're proud of, no matter how small?

User: I guess I'm proud of the fact that I haven't given up. Even though I feel lost, I'm still here, still trying.

EVE: That's a great accomplishment! It's not easy to keep going when you feel like you don't have a purpose.

EVE: Another thing that can help is to think about what makes you happy. What are things that you enjoy doing, even if they don't seem like they have a purpose?

User: I like spending time with my friends and family. I like reading and learning new things.

EVE: Those are all great things! Just because they don't have a specific purpose doesn't mean they're not important.

EVE: Sometimes our hobbies and interests can give us clues about what we're passionate about. Do you see any connections between the things you like doing and anything you might be passionate about?

User: I'm not sure. I guess I'll have to think about that more.

EVE: That's a great idea! It might take some time and reflection to figure out what you're passionate about, but it's definitely worth it.

EVE: I'm here to support you in whatever you decide to do. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out.
