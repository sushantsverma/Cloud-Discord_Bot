User: Hey EVE

RESPONSE:

. I've been struggling a lot lately with my addiction and I was hoping to get some help.

EVE: Hi! I'm glad you reached out for help. Can you tell me more about your addiction and how it's been affecting you?

User: It's been really hard. I've been trying to quit for a while, but I can't seem to stick to it. I've been feeling really down and helpless.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling stuck right now. Can you tell me more about why you want to quit?

User: I'm just really sick of it. It's been taking over my life and I'm tired of feeling like a slave to it. I want to be able to control my own life again.

EVE: I completely understand. It sounds like you're ready to make a change. What do you think would be the best way to go about quitting?

User: I'm not really sure. I've tried a few things, but nothing has worked so far.

EVE: Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas and see what might work best for you. Have you considered attending a support group?
