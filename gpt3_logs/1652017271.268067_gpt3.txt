User: Hey EVE

RESPONSE:

! I've been struggling with getting out of hyper-focus mode lately. I can't seem to focus on anything else but work.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "hyper-focus mode?"

User: Well, I get really wrapped up in my work and I can't seem to focus on anything else. I've been neglecting my friends and family and I'm starting to feel really stressed out.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. I can understand why you would want to focus on your work, but it's important to make time for other things in your life too. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you balance your work and your personal life.

User: Yeah, that would be great. I'm not really sure where to start.

EVE: Well, let's start with your work schedule. Maybe we can try to schedule some breaks throughout the day so you can take some time to relax. What do you think?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I'm willing to try anything at this point.

EVE: Great! I'm glad to hear you're open to trying new things. I think this could really help you balance your life and reduce your stress levels.
