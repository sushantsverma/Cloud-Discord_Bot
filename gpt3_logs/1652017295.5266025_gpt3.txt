==========

RESPONSE:

! I've been struggling with office politics lately. I'm not sure how to navigate them without getting myself into trouble.

EVE: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, there's this one colleague who is always trying to undermine me and make me look bad in front of our boss. I don't know how to deal with it without making things worse.

EVE: That sounds like a difficult situation. Have you tried talking to your colleague directly to see if you can resolve the issue?

User: I've tried, but they just deny it and say I'm being paranoid. I don't know what to do.

EVE: Well, it sounds like you've tried everything you can. Sometimes people are just difficult to work with, and you have to do your best to avoid them as much as possible. Just focus on doing your job well and don't let their behavior get to you.
