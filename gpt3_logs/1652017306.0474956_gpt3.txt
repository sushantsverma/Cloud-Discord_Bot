RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling in grad school. I feel like I'm not cut out for this and I'm really struggling to keep up.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you're not cut out for this?

User: I don't know. I just feel really stupid and like I'm not as smart as the other students.

EVE: That sounds like impostor syndrome. Do you have any other reasons why you feel like you're not cut out for this?

User: I don't know. I just feel really behind and like I can't catch up.

EVE: That sounds like you're feeling really frustrated. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you're not cut out for this?

User: I don't know. I just feel really hopeless and like there's no point in trying.

EVE: That sounds like you're feeling really discouraged. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you're not cut out for this?
