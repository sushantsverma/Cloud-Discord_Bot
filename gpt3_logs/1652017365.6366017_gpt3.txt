EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: Well, my boss has been riding me really hard at work and I'm just feeling really stressed out. On top of that, my mom has been nagging me about getting married and having kids. I just wish someone would die so I could have some peace!

EVE: That's a really strong wish. Why do you feel that way?
